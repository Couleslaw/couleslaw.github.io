## A.1. Glossary of Terms

A comprehensive list of acronyms and technical terms used throughout this guide, along with brief definitions.

- **AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) Compilation:** A compilation strategy where Intermediate Language (IL) code is translated into native machine code at build time, producing a self-contained executable.
- **Assembly:** The fundamental unit of deployment and versioning in .NET. It's a `.dll` or `.exe` file containing IL code, metadata, and a manifest.
- **BCL (Base Class Library):** A comprehensive set of fundamental types and APIs included with the .NET platform, providing core functionalities like collections, I/O, networking, and primitive types.
- **CIL (Common Intermediate Language):** Also known as IL (Intermediate Language) or MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language). A CPU-agnostic bytecode that C# (and other .NET languages) compiles to.
- **CLI (Common Language Infrastructure):** An open specification developed by Microsoft and standardized by ECMA and ISO. It defines the executable code and runtime environment that allows different high-level languages to be used on different computer platforms without being rewritten for specific architectures. The CLR is an implementation of the CLI.
- **CLR (Common Language Runtime):** The virtual machine component of .NET that manages the execution of .NET programs. It implements the VES and is responsible for JIT compilation, garbage collection, type safety, and other runtime services.
- **CTS (Common Type System):** A standard that defines how types are declared, used, and managed in the .NET runtime. It ensures that types written in different .NET languages can interact seamlessly.
- **GC (Garbage Collector):** The automatic memory management system in .NET that identifies and reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced by the application.
- **IL (Intermediate Language):** See CIL.
- **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation:** The primary compilation strategy in .NET where Intermediate Language (IL) code is translated into native machine code by the CLR at runtime, typically on a method-by-method basis when first executed.
- **LOH (Large Object Heap):** A special segment of the managed heap dedicated to allocating objects that are 85KB or larger. Objects on the LOH are not compacted during GC, impacting performance.
- **Managed Code:** Code that is executed and managed by a .NET runtime (like the CLR), benefiting from services such as garbage collection, type safety, and exception handling.
- **Metadata:** Data within a .NET assembly that describes the types, members, references, and other structural information, used by the CLR for execution and by Reflection for runtime introspection.
- **NRTs (Nullable Reference Types):** A C# 8.0 feature that enables the compiler to warn about potential `null` dereferences for reference types, improving null safety.
- **PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization):** A JIT optimization technique where runtime execution data is collected and used to make more informed and aggressive optimizations during subsequent compilation of "hot" code paths.
- **PE (Portable Executable) File:** The file format for executables, DLLs, and object code used by Windows and .NET. .NET assemblies are PE files.
- **SDK (Software Development Kit):** A collection of tools, libraries, compilers, and runtimes that developers install to build applications for a specific platform or framework. The .NET SDK is used to develop .NET applications.
- **VES (Virtual Execution System):** Part of the CLI specification that defines the runtime environment for executing IL code. The CLR is Microsoft's implementation of the VES.

## A.2. Practical Checklist

A concise checklist for writing modern, high-performance, and maintainable .NET code.

### Code Quality & Design

- **Embrace Nullable Reference Types (NRTs) (C# 8+):** Configure your projects for NRTs and use them consistently to prevent `NullReferenceException` at compile-time.
- **Prefer Immutability:** Design types as immutable where appropriate, especially for data transfer objects (`record` types are excellent here). Use `readonly` fields and properties.
- **Use Records (C# 9+, C# 10+):** Leverage `record class` for immutable reference types and `record struct` for immutable value types, benefiting from value equality and concise syntax.
- **Leverage Modern Language Features:** Use pattern matching, expression-bodied members, local functions, and other features to write more concise and readable code.
- **Follow SOLID Principles:** Apply Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles.
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Use DI for loosely coupled and testable components. Prefer constructor injection.
- **Avoid Global State:** Minimize static mutable state where possible to improve testability and reduce concurrency issues.
- **Favor Composition Over Inheritance:** Use interfaces and composition for flexibility and maintainability.
- **Clear Naming Conventions:** Adhere to .NET naming guidelines for clarity and consistency.

### Performance & Memory

- **Value Types (`struct`) vs. Reference Types (`class`):** Understand the memory implications. Use `struct` for small, short-lived data where copy semantics are acceptable, and `class` for larger objects or when reference semantics are needed.
- **Minimize Allocations:** Be mindful of heap allocations, especially in hot code paths. Use `stackalloc`, `Span<T>`, `Memory<T>`, and object pooling where appropriate.
- **Use `Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>` (C# 7.2+):** For high-performance string, array, and memory manipulation without copying data.
- **`in`, `ref`, `out` Parameters:** Use `in` for passing large structs by reference to avoid copying. Understand `ref` and `out` semantics.
- **`ref struct` and `readonly ref struct` (C# 11+):** Use these for stack-allocated types that must not escape the stack, for maximum performance and memory safety.
- **Understand Boxing/Unboxing:** Be aware of the performance and allocation costs associated with boxing value types to `System.Object`.
- **Optimize Collections:** Choose the right collection for the job (`List<T>`, `Dictionary<T>`, `HashSet<T>`, `ConcurrentDictionary<T>`, `ImmutableList<T>`, etc.) considering access patterns and performance characteristics.
- **String Handling:** Use `StringBuilder` for concatenating many strings. Prefer `string.IsNullOrEmpty` or `string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace` for null/empty checks. Consider `ReadOnlySpan<char>` for string parsing.
- **Benchmarking:** Use `BenchmarkDotNet` to scientifically measure and compare code performance.

### Concurrency & Asynchrony

- **`async`/`await`:** Use `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to keep applications responsive and scale efficiently.
- **Cancellation Tokens:** Always propagate and respect `CancellationToken` for cancellable asynchronous operations. Use `CT.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` to check for cancellation.
- **Avoid `async void`:** Generally avoid `async void` methods unless they are event handlers. Use `async Task` instead to allow proper error handling and continuation.
- **Synchronization Primitives:** Understand when to use `lock`, `SemaphoreSlim`, `ReaderWriterLockSlim`, `ConcurrentQueue<T>`, etc., for thread safety.
- **Task Parallel Library (TPL):** Leverage `Task.Run` for CPU-bound work off the main thread, and `Parallel.ForEach`/`For` for data parallelism.

### Testing & Observability

- **Unit Testing:** Write comprehensive unit tests for all business logic. Use frameworks like xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest.
- **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between components and external systems.
- **Structured Logging:** Use structured logging (e.g., Serilog, Microsoft.Extensions.Logging) to capture rich, queryable diagnostic information.
- **Metrics & Tracing:** Implement metrics (e.g., with OpenTelemetry) and distributed tracing to monitor application health and performance in production.
- **Debugging:** Master your IDE's debugger (Visual Studio, VS Code) and utilize .NET diagnostic tools (`dotnet-dump`, `dotnet-trace`, `dotnet-counters`).

### Tooling & Workflow

- **.NET CLI Mastery:** Be proficient with `dotnet` commands for building, running, publishing, and managing projects.
- **NuGet Package Management:** Understand how to manage package dependencies effectively.
- **Source Control:** Use Git effectively for version control and collaboration.
- **CI/CD:** Automate your build, test, and deployment processes using CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
