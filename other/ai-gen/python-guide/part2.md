## 3. Variables, Scope, and Namespaces

In Python, understanding how variables work goes beyond simply assigning values. It delves into the sophisticated mechanisms of **name binding**, **object identity**, and the hierarchical structure of **namespaces** that govern where and how names are looked up. This chapter will demystify these core concepts, providing a robust mental model for how Python manages its runtime environment.

## 3.1. Name Binding: Names vs Objects

One of the most fundamental concepts to grasp in Python is the clear distinction between a **name** (often colloquially called a "variable") and the **object** it refers to. Unlike some other languages where a variable might directly represent a memory location holding a value, in Python, names are merely labels or references that are _bound_ to objects.

Think of it like this: Imagine objects as distinct entities residing in your computer's memory – a number `5`, a string `"hello"`, a list `[1, 2, 3]`. Names, on the other hand, are like sticky notes you attach to these objects. When you write `x = 5`, you're not putting the number `5` _into_ `x`. Instead, you're creating a name `x` and attaching it to the object `5`.

**Name binding** is the process of associating a name with an object. This occurs through various operations:

- **Assignment statements**: `my_variable = "some value"`
- **Function definitions**: `def my_function(): pass` (binds `my_function` to a function object)
- **Class definitions**: `class MyClass: pass` (binds `MyClass` to a class object)
- **`import` statements**: `import math` (binds `math` to the module object)
- **`for` loops**: `for item in my_list:` (binds `item` to elements of `my_list` iteratively)
- **Function parameters**: `def func(param):` (binds `param` to the argument passed)

Multiple names can be bound to the _same_ object. This is a crucial aspect of Python's memory model (which relies on reference counting, as discussed in Chapter 2).
Every object has a unique, immutable identity, which can be retrieved using the `id()` function. This function returns an integer that corresponds to the object's location in memory (in CPython). You can use `id()` to verify if two names refer to the same object: `id(a) == id(b)`. This is the mechanism behind the `is` operator (`a is b`), which checks for identity equality, as opposed to the `==` operator, which checks for value equality by calling the `__eq__` method.

```python
# Immutable object
x = 100
y = x
print(id(x) == id(y)) # True

x = x + 1 # x now points to a new object
print(id(x) == id(y)) # False

# Mutable object
a = [1, 2]
b = a
c = [1, 2]
print(a == b, id(a) == id(b)) # True, True (same object)
print(a == c, id(a) == id(c)) # True, False (different objects, same value)

b.append(3) # Modifies the object both 'a' and 'b' refer to
print(a)    # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(id(a) == id(b)) # True
```

This model means that assignment in Python is always about binding names to objects, not about copying object values. Understanding this distinction is fundamental to predicting behavior, especially when dealing with mutable objects like lists and dictionaries, and avoiding subtle bugs related to unintended side effects.

## 3.2. Variable Lifetime and Identity

The **lifetime** of an object in Python refers to the period during which it exists in memory and is accessible. The **identity** of an object is its unique, unchanging identifier throughout its lifetime. In CPython, this identity corresponds to the object's memory address, which can be retrieved using the built-in `id()` function.

An object's lifetime begins when it is created (e.g., by a literal like `5` or `[]`, or by calling a constructor like `MyClass()`). It ends when its **reference count** drops to zero, and it is subsequently deallocated by the garbage collector (as explained in Chapter 2).

The crucial distinction here is between an object's lifetime and a name's _scope_. A name (variable) exists within a certain **scope** (e.g., local to a function, global to a module). When a name goes out of scope, it no longer refers to its object, and its reference to that object is removed. This decrements the object's reference count. However, the _object itself_ might continue to exist if other names or references elsewhere still point to it.

```python
def create_and_lose_ref():
    my_list = [10, 20, 30] # List object created, 'my_list' refers to it
    print(f"Inside function, ID: {id(my_list)}")
    return my_list

# Call the function, a reference to the list is returned
retained_list = create_and_lose_ref()
print(f"Outside function, ID: {id(retained_list)}")

# The 'my_list' name within create_and_lose_ref() is now gone (out of scope),
# but the list object itself still exists because 'retained_list' refers to it.
del retained_list
# Now the list object's reference count might drop to 0, leading to deallocation.
# (Unless there are other implicit references, e.g., in a console's history)

# Output:
# Inside function,  ID: 2330721804672
# Outside function, ID: 2330721804672
```

For immutable objects (like numbers, strings, tuples), the concept of identity and lifetime can be slightly different due to internal optimizations. CPython often **interns** small integers, common strings, and even some empty immutable containers (like empty tuples) to save memory. This means multiple names might refer to the exact same immutable object even if they were seemingly created independently, because the interpreter reuses existing objects for efficiency.

```python
i = 100
j = 100
print(i is j) # True for small integers (typically -5 to 256)

s1 = "hello"
s2 = "hello"
print(s1 is s2) # True for many common strings (interned)

s3 = "a" * 1000 # Long string, usually not interned by default
s4 = "a" * 1000
print(s3 is s4) # False (likely)
```

Understanding identity and lifetime is critical for debugging subtle issues involving mutable default arguments, unexpected side effects, and memory optimization.

## 3.3. The LEGB Name Resolution Rule

When you use a name in Python, the interpreter needs to know which object that name refers to. This process of name resolution follows a strict order, commonly known as the **LEGB rule**:

1.  **Local (L)**: Python first looks for the name within the **current local scope**. This typically refers to names defined inside the currently executing function or method. These names are temporary and exist only for the duration of the function call.
2.  **Enclosing (E)**: If the name is not found in the local scope, Python then searches the local scopes of any **enclosing functions** (non-global, non-local scopes). This rule is crucial for **closures**, where an inner function "remembers" and accesses names from its outer (enclosing) function's scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.
3.  **Global (G)**: If the name is not found in any enclosing scopes, Python looks in the **current module's global scope**. This includes names defined at the top level of a script or module, as well as names imported from other modules.
4.  **Built-in (B)**: Finally, if the name is still not found, Python checks the **built-in scope**. This scope contains all the names of Python's pre-defined functions, exceptions, and types that are always available (e.g., `print`, `len`, `str`, `Exception`).

Imagine a layered stack: when Python tries to resolve a name, it starts at the innermost layer (Local) and works its way outwards (Enclosing → Global → Built-in). The first definition it finds for that name is the one it uses.

```python
message = "Global message" # Global scope

def outer_function():
    message = "Enclosing message" # Enclosing scope for inner_function
    def inner_function():
        message = "Local message" # Local scope for inner_function
        print(message)
    def another_inner_function():
        # This will look in Enclosing scope first
        print(message)

    inner_function()          # Prints "Local message"
    another_inner_function()  # Prints "Enclosing message"

outer_function()
print(message) # Prints "Global message"
```

This hierarchical lookup mechanism is fundamental to Python's modularity and encapsulation. However, it also means that **name shadowing** can occur, where a name in an inner scope "hides" a name with the same identifier in an outer scope. While useful for preventing accidental modifications, excessive shadowing can lead to subtle bugs if not managed carefully. The LEGB rule is the cornerstone of understanding how Python resolves any identifier you use in your code.

## 3.4. Runtime Scope Introspection

Python provides built-in functions and keywords that allow for introspection and explicit manipulation of name bindings and scope. These tools are powerful for debugging, dynamic code execution, and fine-grained control over names.

- **`globals()`**: This built-in function returns a dictionary representing the **current global namespace**. This dictionary maps names to their corresponding objects in the module scope. You can inspect it to see all global variables and functions defined in the current module. While you _can_ modify this dictionary to add or change global variables, it's generally discouraged outside of very specific meta-programming or debugging scenarios, as it can lead to hard-to-track side effects.

- **`locals()`**: This built-in function returns a dictionary representing the **current local namespace**. In a function, it contains the function's parameters and locally defined variables. At the module level (global scope), `locals()` returns the same dictionary as `globals()`. Similar to `globals()`, modifying the dictionary returned by `locals()` generally has no effect on local variables when returned from a function, as Python optimizes access to local variables directly, not through this dictionary. It's primarily for inspection.

  ```python
  global_var = "I am global"
  print(f"Global scope keys (before def): {list(globals().keys())}")

  def example_function():
      x = 10
      y = 20
      def nested_function():
          x = 30  # This will not affect the outer x

      nested_function()
      print(f"Local scope: {locals()}")

  example_function()
  print(f"Global scope keys (after def): {list(globals().keys())}")

  # Output:
  # Global scope keys (before def): [...builtins..., 'global_var']
  # Local scope: {'x': 10, 'y': 20, 'nested_function': <function example_function.<locals>.nested_function at 0x000002086AB23D80>}
  # Global scope keys (after def): [...builtins..., 'global_var', 'example_function']
  ```

- **`global` keyword**: When used inside a function, the `global` keyword explicitly declares that a name refers to a variable in the **global (module) scope**, not a local one. Without `global`, an assignment to a name inside a function would by default create a new local variable, even if a global variable with the same name exists. `global` allows you to _modify_ a global variable from within a function.

- **`nonlocal` keyword**: Introduced in Python 3, the `nonlocal` keyword is used in nested functions to declare that a name refers to a variable in an **enclosing scope** (any scope that is not global and not local to the current function). This allows an inner function to _modify_ a variable in its immediately enclosing function's scope, which is crucial for building complex closures where state needs to be updated. Without `nonlocal`, a new local variable would be created.

  ```python
    count = 0  # Global
    size = 10  # Global

    def outer():
        global size
        size = 20  # Modify global variable
        count = 1  # Enclosing scope for inner

        def inner():
            nonlocal count
            count += 1  # This would cause UnboundLocalError without 'nonlocal'
            size = 100  # Create a new local variable
            print(f"Innter {count=}, {size=}")

        inner()
        print(f"Outer {count=}, {size=}")

    outer()
    print(f"Global {count=}, {size=}")

    # Output:
    # Innter count=2, size=100
    # Outer count=2, size=20
    # Global count=0, size=20
  ```

- **`del` statement**: The `del` statement removes a name binding from a namespace. When you `del x`, Python removes the name `x` from the current scope. This decrements the reference count of the object `x` was referring to. If that reference count drops to zero, the object's memory is then eligible for deallocation. `del` is distinct from simply assigning `None` to a variable; `del` removes the name itself, while `x = None` simply rebinds the name `x` to the `None` object.

These tools provide powerful mechanisms for understanding and, when necessary, influencing the dynamic nature of Python's scopes and name bindings, essential for advanced programming and debugging.

## 3.5. Namespaces in Modules, Functions, and Classes

Namespaces are mappings from names to objects. They are essentially dictionaries that store the name-to-object bindings at various levels of a Python program. Python uses namespaces to prevent naming conflicts and to encapsulate related names. Every distinct "context" in Python has its own namespace.

1.  **Module Namespaces**: Every Python module (`.py` file) has its own global namespace. When a module is loaded (e.g., via `import my_module`), its entire code is executed, and all names defined at the top level of that module (functions, classes, global variables) become part of its namespace. When you access `my_module.some_function`, Python is looking up `some_function` in `my_module`'s namespace. This modularity ensures that `some_function` in `my_module_A` doesn't conflict with `some_function` in `my_module_B`. Module namespaces are typically represented by the `__dict__` attribute of the module object itself.

    ```python
    # my_module.py
    MY_CONST = 10
    print(f"MY_CONST is {MY_CONST} in my_module")
    def greet():
        return "Hello from my_module"

    # main.py
    import my_module
    print("main: my_module.MY_CONST =", slots.MY_CONST)
    print("main: my_module.greet(): ", slots.greet())
    print("main: my_module names: ", list(slots.__dict__.keys()))

    # Output:
    # MY_CONST is 10 in my_module           <-- executed when imported
    # main: my_module.MY_CONST = 10
    # main: my_module.greet():  Hello from my_module
    # main: my_module names:  [...builtins..., 'MY_CONST', 'greet']
    ```

2.  **Function Namespaces**: Each time a function is called, a new, isolated local namespace is created for that particular call. This namespace holds the function's parameters and any variables defined _inside_ the function. This local namespace is destroyed when the function finishes execution (returns or raises an exception), making function variables temporary and preventing name collisions between different function calls or with global variables (unless explicitly declared `global` or `nonlocal`). This is the "L" and "E" in the LEGB rule.

3.  **Class Namespaces**: Classes also have their own namespaces. When a class is defined, its namespace contains the names of its attributes (e.g., class variables, methods). This namespace serves as a blueprint for instances of that class. When an instance is created, it gets its own instance namespace, which is separate from the class's namespace.

    - **Class Namespace**: Contains class-level attributes and methods. Accessed via `ClassName.attribute` or through the instance if the instance doesn't shadow it (`instance.attribute`).
    - **Instance Namespace**: Created for each object instance. It typically stores instance-specific data (instance variables). When you access `instance.attribute`, Python first looks in the instance's `__dict__` (its own namespace). If not found, it then looks in the class's `__dict__` and then in the `__dict__` of any base classes (Method Resolution Order - MRO). This lookup order is crucial for understanding inheritance and attribute resolution.

    ```python
    class Dog:
        species = "Canis familiaris" # Class variable, in Dog's namespace
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name        # Instance variable, in instance's namespace
        def bark(self):
            return f"{self.name} says Woof!" # Method, in Dog's namespace

    dog1 = Dog("Buddy")
    dog2 = Dog("Lucy")

    print(dog1.name) # 'name' found in dog1's instance namespace
    print(dog2.name) # 'name' found in dog2's instance namespace
    print(Dog.species) # 'species' found in Dog's class namespace
    print(dog1.species) # 'species' found via lookup in Dog's class namespace
    ```

This systematic use of namespaces at different levels is central to Python's object-oriented nature and its ability to manage complexity by encapsulating related data and functionality, preventing unwanted interference between different parts of a program.

## Key Takeaways

- **Name vs. Object**: In Python, names (variables) are labels or references. They are _bound_ to objects. Multiple names can reference the _same_ object. Assignment in Python is always name binding, not value copying.
- **Identity and Lifetime**: An object's `id()` is its unique, unchanging identifier. An object's lifetime begins at creation and ends when its reference count drops to zero. A name's scope (its visibility) is distinct from an object's lifetime; an object can persist even if the name referring to it goes out of scope, as long as other references exist.
- **LEGB Rule**: Python resolves names by searching in a specific order: **L**ocal (current function), **E**nclosing (outer functions), **G**lobal (module), and **B**uilt-in scopes. This rule governs variable visibility and name shadowing.
- **Scope Introspection & Control**:
  - `globals()` returns the global namespace (module scope).
  - `locals()` returns the current local namespace (function scope).
  - `global` keyword allows modification of global variables from a function.
  - `nonlocal` keyword (Python 3+) allows modification of variables in an enclosing (non-global) scope from an inner function.
  - `del` statement removes a name binding, decrementing the object's reference count.
- **Namespaces**: Python uses distinct namespaces (essentially dictionaries) for modules, functions (local and enclosing scopes), and classes/instances to prevent naming collisions and encapsulate state. Attribute lookup for instances follows a specific order: instance namespace → class namespace → base class namespaces (MRO).

## 4. Python’s Import System

The `import` statement in Python, though seemingly simple, orchestrates a sophisticated multi-stage process to bring code from one module into another. This process is fundamental to Python's modular design, enabling code reuse, organization, and encapsulation.

## 4.1. Module resolution

When you write `import my_module`, Python undertakes three primary steps: **finding**, **loading**, and **initializing** the module. This mechanism ensures that a module's code is typically executed only once per process, optimizing performance and preventing side effects from repeated execution.

The **finding** stage begins by consulting `sys.modules`, a global dictionary (a cache) that stores all modules that have already been successfully loaded during the current Python session. If `my_module` is found in `sys.modules`, Python reuses the existing module object, and the loading and initialization steps are skipped. This is crucial for efficiency and for handling scenarios like circular imports, where a module might be "partially" loaded. If the module is not in the cache, Python then proceeds to search for the module's source file or package.

The search for the module's file is governed by `sys.path`, a list of directory strings that defines the module search path. This list typically includes the directory of the entry-point script, directories specified in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, and standard installation directories for Python's libraries. Python iterates through `sys.path` in order, looking for a file named `my_module.py`, a package directory named `my_module` (which would contain an `__init__.py` file), or other module types (like C extension modules). Once found, the **loading** stage takes over, which involves reading the module's code, compiling it into bytecode, and creating a module object.

The final step is **initialization**. During this phase, the module's bytecode is executed within its own dedicated namespace. This top-level execution defines all functions, classes, and variables within that module. These entities then become attributes of the module object itself. This is why, after `import my_module`, you access its contents via `my_module.some_function`. A key nuance here is the `if __name__ == '__main__':` construct. When a Python file is run directly as a script, its `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`. However, when the same file is imported as a module into another script, `__name__` is set to the module's actual name. This idiom allows developers to include code that should only run when the file is executed as the primary script, such as command-line argument parsing or test cases, preventing it from running unnecessarily during an import.

It is highly recommended to always protect the main execution block of your scripts with this idiom. This not only prevents unintended side effects when importing modules but also enhances code clarity and maintainability. It allows you to write reusable modules that can be both executed as standalone scripts and imported into other scripts without executing the main logic unintentionally.

```python
def main():
    # Code that should only run when this file is executed directly
    print("This runs only when executed directly.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## 4.2. Specific Object Imports

The import statement `from my_module import specific_object` (or `from my_package.my_module import specific_object`) differs significantly in its effect on the current scope's namespace compared to `import my_module`. Despite the appearance of only importing a single item, the underlying mechanism still involves the complete **finding, loading, and initializing** of `my_module` (if it hasn't been loaded already). This means that all top-level code within `my_module` is executed regardless of whether you import the whole module or just a piece of it. The primary distinction lies in what gets bound into the _current importing module's namespace_.

When you use `import my_module`, the entire module object (`my_module`) is added to the current namespace. You must then prefix any access to its contents with `my_module.`, for example, `my_module.my_function()`. This clearly indicates the origin of `my_function` and helps avoid name clashes. In contrast, `from my_module import specific_object` directly binds `specific_object` into the current namespace. This allows you to use `specific_object` directly without any prefix, for instance, `specific_object()`.

This direct binding changes the current scope's namespace by making `specific_object` immediately available. While this can lead to more concise code, it also introduces a higher risk of name collisions if `specific_object` shares a name with another variable, function, or class already defined or imported in your current module. For this reason, `from ... import *` (importing all names) is generally discouraged in production code, as it can pollute the namespace and make it difficult to trace where names originated from. The choice between `import my_module` and `from my_module import specific_object` often boils down to a trade-off between verbosity, clarity of origin, and potential for name conflicts within your specific module.

## 4.3. Absolute vs. Relative Imports and Packages

A cornerstone of Python's package system is the **`__init__.py` file**. For a directory to be recognized as a Python package, it traditionally had to contain an `__init__.py` file. This file, even if empty, signals to Python that the directory should be treated as a package when imported, allowing its subdirectories and modules to be imported using dot notation. When a package is imported (e.g., `import my_package`), the code within its `__init__.py` file is executed. This allows packages to perform initialization tasks, define package-level variables, or control what names are exposed when a package is imported directly (e.g., via `from my_package import *` by defining `__all__`). Modern Python (3.3+) also supports **namespace packages**, which are directories _without_ an `__init__.py` file. These allow multiple directories to contribute to the same logical package namespace, which is useful for large, distributed projects, but for standard single-directory packages, `__init__.py` remains the conventional way to define a package.

Python offers two pays of importing modules ━ **absolute imports** and **relative imports**. Absolute imports, like `import package.module` or `from package.module import name`, specify the full path from the project's root package, making them unambiguous and generally preferred for clarity and robustness. Relative imports, such as `from . import sibling_module` or `from .. import parent_module`, are used within packages to refer to modules relative to the current one. They are concise for intra-package references but can be less readable and are only valid when the module is part of a package being imported. The `.` denotes the current package, `..` the parent package, `...` the grandparent, and so on. Relative imports are particularly useful in large packages where absolute paths would be cumbersome, but they can lead to confusion if not used carefully.

```
__init__.py
main.py
my_package/
    __init__.py
    module_a.py
    module_b.py
    subpackage/
        __init__.py
        module_c.py
```

```python
# in my_package/module_a.py
from . import module_b
from .subpackage import module_c

# in subpackage/module_c.py
from ..module_a import some_function
from my_package.module_b import another_function

# in main.py
import my_package.module_a
from my_package.subpackage import module_c
```

## 4.4. Circular Imports and Module Reloading

While a module is typically only loaded once, there are scenarios where **reloading** a module is necessary, particularly during interactive development or when testing changes to a module without restarting the entire interpreter. `importlib.reload(my_module)` forces Python to re-execute the module's code, updating its contents in `sys.modules`. However, reloading has significant limitations: old objects created from the previous version of the module are not updated, and references to functions or classes from the old version will still point to the old definitions, which can lead to subtle bugs. It should be used with caution.

Finally, **circular imports** represent a common pitfall. This occurs when module A imports module B, and module B simultaneously imports module A. Python's import mechanism, by caching partially loaded modules in `sys.modules`, can sometimes resolve simple circular imports without error. However, if the mutual imports happen at the top level and depend on attributes not yet defined, it can lead to `AttributeError` or `ImportError` because one module tries to access a name from the other before that name has been fully bound. Careful design, often by refactoring common dependencies into a third module or using local imports (importing within a function or method), is required to resolve such issues.

## 4.5. Advanced Import Mechanisms

Python's import mechanism, while seemingly straightforward on the surface, is a powerful and extensible system. At its core, the `import` statement leverages **import hooks** to locate, load, and initialize modules. These hooks provide points of intervention during the import process, allowing developers to customize how Python finds and loads modules. Traditionally, one might interact with `sys.path` to add directories where Python should look for modules. However, import hooks offer a much deeper level of control, enabling exotic import mechanisms, such as loading modules from a database, a remote URL, or even encrypted files. This extensibility is achieved through "finder" and "loader" objects, which register themselves with the import system to handle specific types of module requests.

The **`importlib`** module in Python's standard library provides a programmatic interface to the import system. It exposes the various components and functionalities that the `import` statement uses internally, allowing developers to implement custom import logic or to interact with the import system directly. For instance, `importlib.import_module()` offers a programmatic way to import a module given its string name, which is invaluable when the module name is not known until runtime. More profoundly, `importlib` contains the machinery for defining custom import hooks, such as `PathFinder` (which handles entries on `sys.path`), `MetaPathFinder` (for more generic module finding), and `PathEntryFinder` (for finding modules within specific path entries).

By implementing custom finder and loader classes and registering them with `sys.meta_path` or `sys.path_hooks`, developers can completely alter Python's module loading behavior. For example, a custom finder might scan a compressed `.zip` file for modules, while a custom loader could decrypt an `.pyc` file before passing its bytecode to the PVM. This advanced capability is foundational for tools like `zipimporter` (which allows importing from zip files), package managers, or systems that dynamically generate code. While implementing import hooks is a relatively advanced topic, understanding their existence and the role of `importlib` demystifies the `import` statement and reveals the incredible flexibility built into Python's module system.

## Key Takeaways

- **Three Stages of Import**: Python imports involve **finding** (checking `sys.modules` and `sys.path`), **loading** (compiling code and creating a module object), and **initializing** (executing module code in its own namespace).
- **Module Execution**: A module's top-level code is executed _only once_ upon its first import. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` idiom is used to run code only when a file is executed as a script, not when imported as a module.
- **Namespace Impact**:
  - `import my_module`: Binds the `my_module` object itself into the current namespace, requiring prefixed access (`my_module.item`).
  - `from my_module import specific_object`: Directly binds `specific_object` into the current namespace, allowing direct access (`specific_object()`). The entire module is still loaded.
- **Absolute vs. Relative Imports**: Absolute imports specify the full path from the root package, while relative imports use dot notation to refer to sibling or parent modules within a package. The `__init__.py` file is essential for defining packages, though namespace packages (without `__init__.py`) are also supported.
- **Reloading Modules**: `importlib.reload(my_module)` forces a module to be reloaded, executing its code again. This can lead to issues with old references, so it should be used cautiously.
- **Circular Imports**: Circular dependencies between modules can lead to `ImportError` or `AttributeError`. Careful design, such as using local imports or refactoring shared code into a separate module, is necessary to avoid these pitfalls.
- **Import Hooks and `importlib`**: Python's import system is extensible through import hooks, allowing custom module loading mechanisms. The `importlib` module provides a programmatic interface to the import system, enabling custom finders and loaders to alter how modules are located and loaded.

## 5. Functions and Callables

Functions are one of the most powerful and flexible constructs in Python. They allow you to encapsulate reusable logic, manage complexity, and create abstractions. Understanding how functions work, their properties, and how they interact with Python's object model is crucial for effective programming.

## 5.1. Functions and Closures

In Python, functions are first-class objects. This means they can be treated like any other object: assigned to variables, stored in data structures, passed as arguments, or returned as results. This property is fundamental to patterns like decorators and higher-order functions.

A closure is a function object that "remembers" values from its enclosing lexical scope, even after that scope has finished executing. When a nested function references a variable from its containing function, Python bundles the function code with these "free variables" from its environment. This allows a returned inner function to still access, for example, the arguments passed to the outer function that created it.

```python
def make_multiplier(n):
    # 'multiplier' is a closure, capturing 'n'
    def multiplier(x):
        return x * n
    return multiplier

times10 = make_multiplier(10)
print(times10(5)) # Output: 50
```

### Late Binding Closures

In closures, if a loop variable is used in the inner function, its value is looked up when the inner function is _called_, not when it's defined. This means all functions created in the loop might end up using the _last_ value of the loop variable.

**Avoidance**: To capture the variable's value at the time the inner function is defined, pass it as a default argument to the inner function.

```python
multipliers = [lambda x: i * x for i in range(5)]

for multiply in multipliers:
    print(multiply(3))  # Output: 12 (all use the last value of i, which is 4)

fix_multipliers = [lambda x, i=i: i * x for i in range(5)]
for multiply in fix_multipliers:
    print(multiply(3))  # Output: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12
```

## 5.2. Inside The Function Object

Functions are objects, so they possess attributes. These "dunder" (double-underscore) attributes provide introspection into how a function is constructed and behaves.

The most important is `__code__`, a code object containing the compiled bytecode, information about arguments, local variables, and free variables needed for closures. Other useful attributes include:

- `__defaults__`: A tuple of default values for positional arguments.
- `__kwdefaults__`: A dictionary for keyword-only default arguments.
- `__annotations__`: A dictionary of type annotations for parameters and return values.
- `__name__`: The function's name.
- `__doc__`: The function's docstring.

Inspecting these attributes is a powerful technique for debugging and metaprogramming.

```python
def greet(name: str, message="Hello") -> str:
    """Greets the given name with a message."""
    return f"{message}, {name}!"

print(greet.__name__)             # greet
print(greet.__doc__)              # Greets the given name with a message.
print(greet.__defaults__)         # ('Hello',)
print(greet.__annotations__)      # {'name': <class 'str'>, 'return': <class 'str'>}
print(greet.__code__.co_varnames) # ('name', 'message')
```

## 5.3. Argument Handling: `*args` and `**kwargs`

When a function is called, Python's PVM binds the provided arguments to the defined parameters.

**Default argument values** are evaluated only once, at the time the `def` statement is executed. This leads to a common "mutable default argument" pitfall: if a mutable object (like a list or dictionary) is used as a default, all calls to that function that don't provide a value for that argument will share the exact same object.

```python
def add_item(item, my_list=[]):
    my_list.append(item)
    return my_list

print(add_item(1))    # Output: [1]
print(add_item(2))    # Output: [1, 2] - shared list!

def add_item_fixed(item, my_list=None):
    if my_list is None:
        my_list = []
    my_list.append(item)
    return my_list

print(add_item_fixed(1)) # Output: [1]
print(add_item_fixed(2)) # Output: [2] - new list each time
```

The `*args` and `**kwargs` syntax allows functions to accept a variable number of arguments.

- `*args` collects any extra positional arguments into a tuple.
- `**kwargs` collects any extra keyword arguments into a dictionary.
- the symbols `/` and `*` in function signatures indicate positional-only and keyword-only parameters can follow.

These are also used in function calls to unpack sequences or dictionaries into individual arguments.

```python
def args_function(a, b=2, *args, c, d=6, **kwargs):
    print(f"a = {a}")              # Positional-only
    print(f"b = {b}")              # Positional-only
    print(f"args = {args}")        # Extra positional arguments as tuple
    print(f"c = {c}")              # Keyword-only
    print(f"d = {d}")              # Keyword-only (with default)
    print(f"kwargs = {kwargs}")    # Extra keyword arguments as dict

# Call the function with extra positional and keyword arguments
args_function(
    1, 3,         # a, b — must be positional
    10, 11, 12,   # captured by *args = (10, 11, 12)
    c=20,         # c — must be keyword
    g=30, h=40    # captured by **kwargs = {'g': 30, 'h': 40}
)

def kwargs_delim_function(a, b, /, c, d=4, *, e, f=6, **kwargs):
    print(f"a = {a}")              # Positional-only
    print(f"b = {b}")              # Positional-only
    print(f"c = {c}")              # Positional or keyword
    print(f"d = {d}")              # Positional or keyword (with default)
    print(f"e = {e}")              # Keyword-only (required)
    print(f"f = {f}")              # Keyword-only (has default)
    print(f"kwargs = {kwargs}")    # Additional keyword arguments

# Call with mixed arguments
kwargs_delim_function(
    1, 2,        # a, b — must be positional
    c=3,         # c — can be keyword or positional
    e=5,         # e — must be keyword
    extra=99     # captured by **kwargs = {'extra': 99}
)
```

## 5.4. Lambdas and Higher-Order Functions

- **Lambdas**: A concise way to create small, anonymous functions restricted to a single expression. They implicitly return the result of that expression. Commonly used for simple operations where a full `def` statement would be verbose, e.g., as a `key` for `sorted()`.

  ```python
    numbers = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
    sorted_by_square = sorted(numbers, key=)
    print(sorted_by_square)
  ```

- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take one or more functions as arguments, return a function as their result, or both. `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()` are classic examples.

  ```python
    def my_map(func, data):
        return [func(x) for x in data]

    print(my_map(lambda x: x*x, [1, 2, 3]))
  ```

- **`functools.partial`**: Creates a new "partial" function object from an existing function with some arguments pre-filled. This is excellent for creating specialized versions of general-purpose functions, promoting code reuse.

  ```python
    from functools import partial

    def power(base, exponent):
        return base ** exponent

    square = partial(power, exponent=2)
    cube = partial(power, exponent=3)

    print(square(5)) # Output: 25 (5^2)
    print(cube(2))   # Output: 8 (2^3)
  ```

These constructs are incredibly powerful for functional programming patterns, allowing you to write more abstract and reusable code. They also enable the creation of custom control structures, like decorators, which can modify or enhance the behavior of functions without changing their core logic.

## 5.5. Function Decorators

A decorator is syntactic sugar for a common functional pattern: a callable that takes another function as input and returns a new function. The `@my_decorator` syntax is equivalent to `my_func = my_decorator(my_func)`. This allows you to "wrap" a function to add functionality (e.g., logging, timing, caching) without modifying its original code.

A common pitfall is losing the original function's metadata (name, docstring, annotations). The wrapper function replaces the original, so introspection tools see the wrapper's attributes. To solve this, always use the `@functools.wraps` decorator inside your own decorator. It copies the relevant attributes from the original function to your wrapper, ensuring decorated functions behave transparently.

```python
import functools

def log_calls(func):
    @functools.wraps(func) # Preserves original function metadata
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_calls
def add(a, b):
    """Adds two numbers."""
    return a + b

print(add(3, 5))
print(add.__doc__)  # metadata preserved
```

### Decorator Ordering

When applying multiple decorators to a single function, their order matters. Decorators are applied from bottom-up (closest to the function definition first, then outwards). This means the "top" decorator wraps the result of the "next" decorator, and so on. Understanding this order is crucial when decorators interact with each other's outputs or side effects.

**Avoidance**: Always explicitly consider the order of operations. Think of it as `decorator1(decorator2(my_function))`.

```python
def reverse_result(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)[::-1]
    return wrapper

def add_exclamation(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs) + "!"
    return wrapper

@reverse_result
@add_exclamation
def get_message(text):
    return text

# Equivalent to reverse_result(add_exclamation(get_message))

print(get_message("hello")) # Output: "!olleh"
```

## Key Takeaways

- Functions are first-class objects, enabling powerful patterns like closures and higher-order functions.
- The `__code__`, `__defaults__`, and `__annotations__` attributes provide deep introspection into function internals.
- Understand `*args`, `**kwargs` for flexible argument handling, and be wary of mutable default argument pitfalls.
- Lambdas are concise for simple, anonymous functions; `functools.partial` specializes functions.
- Decorators provide a clean way to add functionality to functions; always use `@functools.wraps` to preserve metadata.
- Be aware of common pitfalls like mutable default arguments, late binding in closures, and decorator application order.

## 6. Classes and Data Structures

Classes in Python are a fundamental part of its object-oriented programming paradigm. They allow you to define custom data structures that encapsulate both data and behavior, promoting code organization, reuse, and abstraction. Understanding classes, their attributes, methods, and how they interact with Python's object model is essential for effective programming.

## 6.1. Classes as Objects

Just as functions are objects, classes are also objects. When the `class` keyword is used, Python creates a new object of type `type`. That's right — the type of a class is `type`. `type` is a **metaclass**, which is a class whose instances are other classes. You can see this yourself: `type(int)` is `type`, and `type(MyClass)` is `type`. Every object has a type, which can be accessed via its `__class__` attribute.

```python
class MyClass:
    pass

instance = MyClass()

print(instance.__class__) # Output: <class '__main__.MyClass'>
print(MyClass.__class__)  # Output: <class 'type'>
```

This "everything is an object" model, which extends even to classes, is what makes Python's object system so dynamic. Because classes are objects, they can be created at runtime, stored in variables, and passed to functions just like any other object. This is the foundation of metaclasses, which are an advanced feature allowing you to customize the class creation process itself.

## 6.2. Instance vs Class Attributes

Namespaces are key to understanding the difference between instance and class attributes. In Python, attributes can be defined at the class level (class attributes) or at the instance level (instance attributes).

- **Class attributes** are defined directly within the class body but outside any method. They are shared by all instances of that class. You access them via the class name (`ClassName.attribute`) or via an instance (`instance.attribute`). If accessed via an instance, Python first checks the instance's namespace; if not found, it then checks the class's namespace.
- **Instance attributes** are typically defined inside methods (most commonly in `__init__`) using `self.attribute = value`. They are unique to each instance and are stored in the instance's `__dict__`.

Modifying a class attribute via an instance name will _create a new instance attribute_ with that name, shadowing the class attribute for that specific instance, rather than modifying the shared class attribute. Modifying a class attribute via the class name, however, affects all instances.

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris" # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name # Instance attribute

dog1 = Dog("Buddy")
dog2 = Dog("Lucy")

print(dog1.species) # Output: Canis familiaris
print(dog2.species) # Output: Canis familiaris

Dog.species = "Domestic Dog" # Modify class attribute
print(dog1.species) # Output: Domestic Dog

dog1.species = "Wolf" # Creates an instance attribute 'species' for dog1
print(dog1.species) # Output: Wolf (instance attribute)
print(dog2.species) # Output: Domestic Dog (still class attribute)
print(Dog.species)  # Output: Domestic Dog (class attribute unchanged directly)
```

## 6.3. Method Resolution Order and `super()`

In languages that support multiple inheritance, the interpreter needs a clear rule to decide which parent class method to use if a method is defined in multiple parents. This is called the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**.

Python 2 used a different MRO, but Python 3 uses the C3 linearization algorithm, which ensures that:

1.  Subclasses appear before their parents.
2.  The order of parental classes in the class definition is preserved.
3.  Each class is listed exactly once.

You can inspect a class's MRO using `ClassName.mro()` or `ClassName.__mro__`.

The built-in `super()` function is used to delegate method calls to a parent or sibling class according to the MRO. It's particularly useful in complex inheritance hierarchies to ensure that initialization or other method logic from all relevant base classes is executed.

```python
class A:
    def method(self):
        print("Method from A")

class B(A):
    def method(self):
        print("Method from B")
        super().method() # Call A's method

class C(A):
    def method(self):
        print("Method from C")
        super().method() # Call A's method

class D(B, C):
    def method(self):
        print("Method from D")
        super().method() # Call the next method in MRO

print(D.mro()) # Inspect the MRO
# Output: [<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]

d_instance = D()
d_instance.method()
# Output:
# Method from D
# Method from B
# Method from C
# Method from A
```

## 6.4. Dunder Methods

Python's object model is largely defined by a set of special methods, often called "dunder" methods (due to their double underscores, e.g., `__init__`). These methods allow classes to implement operator overloading, customize instance creation and deletion, control attribute access, define how objects are represented as strings, and much more. They are the hooks Python uses to interact with your objects. These are some of the dunder methods for complex class management:

- `__init__(self, ...)`: The constructor; called _after_ the object has been created by `__new__` to initialize its state.
- `__new__(cls, ...)`: The class method responsible for _creating_ and returning a new instance of the class. It's called before `__init__`.
- `__str__(self)`: Defines the informal string representation of an object (for `str()` and `print()`).
- `__repr__(self)`: Defines the "official" string representation (for `repr()`), often used for debugging.
- `__getattr__(self, name)`: Called when an attribute lookup fails in the usual places (instance `__dict__`, class, parent classes). Useful for dynamic attribute access.
- `__setattr__(self, name, value)`: Called for every attribute assignment.
- `__delattr__(self, name)`: Called for every attribute deletion.
- `__call__(self, ...)`: Makes an instance of the class callable like a function.

```python
class Book:
    def __new__(cls, title, author):
        # __new__ is called first, creates the instance
        print(f"Creating a new Book instance for '{title}'")
        instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return instance

    def __init__(self, title, author):
        # __init__ is called after __new__, initializes the instance
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        print(f"Initializing Book: {self.title} by {self.author}")

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Book: '{self.title}' by {self.author}"

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Book(title='{self.title}', author='{self.author}')"

my_book = Book("The Python Guide", "Author X")
print(my_book)       # Uses __str__
print(repr(my_book)) # Uses __repr__

class DynamicAccess:
    def __getattr__(self, name):
        if name == "dynamic_attribute":
            return "This was accessed dynamically!"
        raise AttributeError(f"'{type(self).__name__}' object has no attribute '{name}'")

dyn_obj = DynamicAccess()
print(dyn_obj.dynamic_attribute)
try:
    print(dyn_obj.non_existent)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(e)
```

You can also implement operator overloading by defining methods like `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, etc. This allows you to use standard operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) with your custom objects, making them behave like built-in types.

```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Vector):
            return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
        return NotImplemented
```

There are many more dunder methods that you can implement to customize your classes, such as

- `__len__` for `len()`
- `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` for indexing: `obj[key]`
- `__iter__` for iteration: `for item in obj`
- `__contains__` for membership tests: `item in obj`
- `__hash__` for hashability, allowing instances to be used as dictionary keys or in sets.

The full list can be found in the [Python Data Model documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types).

## 6.5. Private Atributes

Python does not have strict access control like some other languages (e.g., `private`, `protected`, `public`). Instead, it uses a convention for "private" attributes: prefixing the attribute name with a double underscore (`__`). This triggers **name mangling**, where Python changes the name of the attribute to include the class name, making it harder (but not impossible) to access from outside the class.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private_attr = "I am private!"
    def get_private_attr(self):
        return self.__private_attr

instance = MyClass()
print(instance._MyClass__private_attr)  # Accessing the mangled name
print(instance.__private_attr)          # Raises AttributeError
```

It is a best practice to use this convention for attributes that are intended to be private. Even though it does not make outside access impossible, it prevent accidental access and signals to other developers that the attribute is not part of the public API of the class. As a bonus, it helps avoid name clashes in subclasses.

## 6.6. Metaclasses

Because classes are objects created by the `type` metaclass, you can create them dynamically without using the `class` keyword. The `type(name, bases, dict)` function manufactures a new class object. `name` is the class name string, `bases` is a tuple of parent classes, and `dict` is a dictionary containing the class attributes and methods. This is what the `class` statement does under the hood.

```python
def hello_method(self):
    return "Hello from dynamically created class!"

DynamicClass = type('DynamicClass', (object,), {'greeting': 'Hi', 'say_hello': hello_method})

dyn_instance = DynamicClass()
print(dyn_instance.greeting)
print(dyn_instance.say_hello())
print(type(DynamicClass)) # Still <class 'type'>
```

For even more control over class creation, you can define **custom metaclasses**. A custom metaclass is a class that inherits from `type` and overrides its behavior, typically by implementing methods like `__new__` (to control instance creation of _the class_) or `__init__` (to initialize the class object after it's created). Metaclasses are powerful but complex tools, usually reserved for advanced use cases like ORMs, dependency injection frameworks, or enforcing API contracts.

```python
class MyMetaclass(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Add a custom attribute to all classes created by this metaclass
        dct['added_by_metaclass'] = "This was added by MyMetaclass!"
        # Optionally modify methods or validate class definition here
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyRegularClass(metaclass=MyMetaclass):
    pass

class AnotherClass(MyRegularClass):
    pass

print(MyRegularClass.added_by_metaclass)  # Output: This was added by MyMetaclass!
print(AnotherClass.added_by_metaclass)    # Output: This was added by MyMetaclass!
```

## 6.7. Class Decorators

Building upon the concept of function decorators, **class decorators** extend this powerful meta-programming technique to class definitions. A class decorator is essentially a callable (usually a function) that takes a class object as its single argument and returns either the same class object (modified) or a new class object. It runs immediately after the class definition is executed but _before_ the class object is assigned to its name in the enclosing scope. This allows you to inspect, modify, or even replace a class entirely at the point of its creation.

The mechanism mirrors that of function decorators: `@my_decorator` placed directly above a `class MyClass:` definition means that `MyClass = my_decorator(MyClass)` is effectively executed behind the scenes. This provides a clean, declarative syntax for applying transformations to classes, centralizing common behaviors or checks that would otherwise need to be manually implemented in every class. While less frequently used than method decorators, class decorators are incredibly powerful for frameworks, ORMs, and other metaprogramming scenarios where you need to hook into the class definition process.

Class decorators shine in several advanced use cases:

- **Validation**: They can inspect the defined methods and attributes of a class to ensure it adheres to certain contracts or contains specific required components. For example, a decorator could check if all abstract methods from a base class are implemented, or if a class has specific data fields.
- **Registration**: A common pattern is to use class decorators to automatically register classes in a central registry or collection. This is useful for plugin architectures, command dispatchers, or test discovery frameworks, where you want to collect all classes of a certain type without manually listing them.
- **Adding/Modifying Methods Dynamically**: Decorators can inject new methods, properties, or attributes into the class at creation time, or modify existing ones. This can reduce boilerplate for common functionalities, such as adding logging capabilities, utility methods, or hooks for lifecycle events.
- **Dependency Injection or Configuration**: They can integrate classes with specific frameworks, injecting dependencies or configuring class-level settings based on the decorator's logic.

```python
from functools import wraps

# 1. Class Decorator for Registration
_registered_commands = {}

def register_command(command_name: str):
    def decorator(cls):
        if not hasattr(cls, 'execute'):
            raise TypeError(f"Class {cls.__name__} must have an 'execute' method to be a command.")
        _registered_commands[command_name] = cls
        print(f"Registered command: {command_name} with class {cls.__name__}")
        return cls # Return the original class, potentially modified
    return decorator

# 2. Class Decorator for Adding a Method (Simple Example)
def add_timestamp_method(cls):
    def get_timestamp(self):
        import datetime
        return datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()
    cls.get_creation_timestamp = get_timestamp
    return cls

@register_command("greet")
@add_timestamp_method
class GreetingCommand:
    def __init__(self, message: str):
        self.message = message

    def execute(self):
        print(f"Executing GreetingCommand: {self.message}")
        print(f"Command created at: {self.get_creation_timestamp()}") # Method added by decorator

@register_command("info")
class InfoCommand:
    def execute(self):
        print("Executing InfoCommand: Displaying system info...")

# Accessing registered commands
if "greet" in _registered_commands:
    cmd_class = _registered_commands["greet"]
    instance = cmd_class("Hello, World!")
    instance.execute()

if "info" in _registered_commands:
    _registered_commands["info"]().execute()

# Output:
# Registered command: greet with class GreetingCommand
# Registered command: info with class InfoCommand
# Executing GreetingCommand: Hello, World!
# Command created at: 2025-06-21T00:50:53.681865
# Executing InfoCommand: Displaying system info...
```

## 6.8. Slotted Classes

For classes with a large number of instances and a fixed set of attributes, defining `__slots__` can significantly reduce memory consumption. By default, instances store their attributes in a dictionary (`__dict__`), which adds overhead. When `__slots__` is defined, Python instead allocates a fixed, contiguous block of memory for only the named attributes, bypassing the `__dict__`. This can be a substantial optimization for memory-intensive applications creating millions of small objects, as it avoids the memory footprint of a dictionary for each instance.

However, using `__slots__` comes with important trade-offs. Instances of classes with `__slots__` cannot have new attributes added dynamically after initialization, unless `__dict__` is explicitly included in `__slots__` itself (which defeats the primary memory optimization). Similarly, instances cannot be weak-referenced unless `__weakref__` is also listed in `__slots__`. Furthermore, complex inheritance scenarios involving multiple base classes that all define `__slots__` can sometimes lead to issues if the slot names clash or if `__slots__` is not handled consistently across the hierarchy. Therefore, while a powerful optimization, `__slots__` should be applied judiciously where its memory benefits outweigh these flexibilities.

For a more detailed explenamtion, watch mCodings [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwf17zsDAnY&t=113s).

```python
class CompactPoint:
    __slots__ = ('x', 'y') # Only 'x' and 'y' attributes are allowed
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

class RegularPoint:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

# Memory comparison

def getsize(obj):
    """
    Recursively calculates the size of an object, including its __slots__ and __dict__ if present.
    """
    size = sys.getsizeof(obj)
    if hasattr(obj, "__slots__"):
        size += sum([getsize(getattr(obj, slot)) for slot in obj.__slots__])
    if hasattr(obj, "__dict__"):
        size += sys.getsizeof(obj.__dict__) + sum([getsize(v) for v in obj.__dict__.values()])
    return size

print(getsize(CompactPoint(1, 2)))  # 104 bytes on 64 bit Python
print(getsize(RegularPoint(1, 2)))  # 400 bytes on 64 bit Python
```

## 6.9. Dataclasses

With the introduction of **`dataclasses` (PEP 557)** in Python 3.7, the landscape for defining data-centric classes significantly improved. `dataclasses` provide a decorator-based mechanism to automatically generate common "boilerplate" methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` (and other rich comparison methods) based on type-annotated class variables. This drastically reduces the amount of repetitive code typically required for simple data holders, making them more concise, readable, and maintainable. They are essentially regular Python classes, but enhanced with automated functionality driven by their type hints.

The primary motivation behind `dataclasses` was to offer a superior alternative to manually writing `__init__` and related methods, which can be tedious and error-prone for classes whose main purpose is to store data. By leveraging type annotations, dataclasses allow static type checkers to enforce the expected types of their fields, integrating seamlessly with modern type-safe development practices. When you decorate a class with `@dataclass`, Python's class creation machinery introspects the type-annotated attributes and dynamically inserts the necessary dunder methods into the class namespace, much like a code generator operating at definition time.

### Basic Usage and Key Features

Using a dataclass is as simple as decorating a class with `@dataclass` and defining its fields with type annotations.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Point:
    x: float
    y: float

# Instances are created like regular classes
p = Point(1.0, 2.0)
print(p) # Output: Point(x=1.0, y=2.0) --> __repr__ is auto-generated
print(p.x) # Output: 1.0

p2 = Point(1.0, 2.0)
print(p == p2) # Output: True --> __eq__ is auto-generated
```

Key features and considerations for dataclasses include:

- **Default Values**: Fields can have default values, just like function arguments.
  ```python
  @dataclass
  class Person:
      name: str
      age: int = 0 # Default value
  p = Person("Alice")
  print(p.age) # Output: 0
  ```
- **`field()` function**: For more advanced control over field behavior (e.g., excluding a field from `__init__` or `__repr__`, providing a default factory for mutable defaults), you use the `dataclasses.field()` function.

  ```python
  from dataclasses import dataclass, field

  @dataclass
  class Item:
      id: int
      name: str
      tags: list[str] = field(default_factory=list) # Correct way for mutable defaults

  item = Item(1, "Book")
  print(item.tags) # Output: []
  item.tags.append("fiction")
  print(item.tags) # Output: ['fiction']

  item2 = Item(2, "Pen")
  print(item2.tags) # Output: [] (not shared with item)
  ```

- **Immutability (`frozen=True`)**: By setting `frozen=True` in the `@dataclass` decorator, instances become immutable after initialization. Attempting to modify a field after creation will raise a `FrozenInstanceError` at runtime. This is extremely useful for creating thread-safe data objects or ensuring data integrity.

  ```python
  @dataclass(frozen=True)
  class ImmutablePoint:
      x: float
      y: float

  ip = ImmutablePoint(10.0, 20.0)
  # ip.x = 15.0 # This would raise dataclasses.FrozenInstanceError
  ```

- **Slotting (`slots=True`)**: You can also use `slots=True` to make the dataclass use `__slots__`, which reduces memory usage by preventing the creation of a `__dict__` for each instance. There is usually no reason not to use `slots` with dataclasses.

  ```python
  @dataclass(slots=True)
  class SlottedPoint:
      x: float
      y: float
  ```

- **`__post_init__`**: For validation or any initialization logic that depends on other fields after the initial `__init__` has run, you can define a `__post_init__` method. This method is called automatically after the auto-generated `__init__` has processed all fields.

  ```python
  @dataclass
  class User:
      first_name: str
      last_name: str
      full_name: str = field(init=False, repr=False) # Not initialized by __init__, not in repr

      def __post_init__(self):
          self.full_name = f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"

  user = User("John", "Doe")
  print(user.full_name) # Output: John Doe
  ```

- **Inheritance**: Dataclasses support inheritance. Subclasses can add new fields and methods, and the generated `__init__` will correctly handle fields from both the base and derived classes.

### The `attrs` Module

While `dataclasses` are powerful, some developers prefer the `attrs` library, which predates `dataclasses` and offers similar functionality with additional features. `attrs` provides a more flexible API for defining classes, including support for validators, converters, and more complex field definitions. It also allows for more customization of the generated methods.

## 6.10. Essential Decorators

Writing effective and maintainable Python classes goes beyond just understanding object-oriented concepts; it involves leveraging Python's unique features and decorators to create clean, robust, and idiomatic code. Modern Python provides several decorators that simplify common class patterns and enhance both readability and type safety.

### `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`

These two decorators define methods that are bound to the class itself or not bound at all, rather than to an instance.

- **`@staticmethod`**: A static method does not receive an implicit first argument (`self` or `cls`). It behaves like a regular function defined inside a class, with no access to the instance or the class itself. It's primarily used for utility functions that logically belong to the class but don't need any class-specific data or state. It enhances code organization by keeping related utilities close to the class they serve.

- **`@classmethod`**: A class method receives the class itself as its first implicit argument, conventionally named `cls`. This allows class methods to access and modify class attributes or call other class methods. They are most commonly used for alternative constructors (e.g., `from_string`), factory methods, or methods that operate on the class state.

```python
class Calculator:
    _version = "1.0" # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    @classmethod
    def get_version(cls):
        return f"Calculator Version: {cls._version}"

    @classmethod
    def from_string(cls, num_str: str):
        return cls(float(num_str))

print(Calculator.add(5, 3))         # Call static method via class
print(Calculator.get_version())     # Call class method via class

calc_from_str = Calculator.from_string("123.45")
print(calc_from_str.value)
```

### `@property`

The `@property` decorator is a powerful feature for defining "managed attributes" – attributes whose access (getting, setting, or deleting) is controlled by methods. This allows you to encapsulate logic, perform validation, or compute values dynamically when an attribute is accessed, all while maintaining the simple dot-notation access syntax (`obj.attribute`).

It transforms a method into a getter, and can be extended with `@attribute.setter` and `@attribute.deleter` to define how the attribute is set or deleted. This mechanism promotes encapsulation, allowing you to change the internal implementation of an attribute without affecting the public interface of your class. It's often used for attributes that are computed, derived from other data, or require validation before assignment.

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius

    @property
    def radius(self):
        """The radius of the circle."""
        return self._radius

    @radius.setter
    def radius(self, value):
        if not isinstance(value, (int, float)) or value < 0:
            raise ValueError("Radius must be a non-negative number")
        self._radius = value

    @property
    def area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self._radius ** 2

my_circle = Circle(5)
print(my_circle.radius) # Accesses the getter
print(my_circle.area)   # Accesses the computed property

my_circle.radius = 10   # Uses the setter
print(my_circle.area)

try:
    my_circle.radius = -2 # Triggers validation in setter
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

### `@overload`

The `@overload` decorator, part of the `typing` module, is used exclusively for **static type checking**. It allows you to define a function (or method) that has multiple distinct type signatures, depending on the types of arguments it receives. Python itself does not support function overloading at runtime in the traditional sense (it will only use the last defined function with that name); `@overload` is a directive to static type checkers like Mypy or Pyright.

You define multiple `@overload` decorated functions, each with a different signature but the same name. Crucially, only the _last_ definition contains the actual implementation logic. Type checkers use these `@overload` definitions to determine the correct return type based on the arguments provided by the caller, ensuring precise type inference for functions that handle varied inputs.

```python
from typing import overload

@overload
def process_data(data: str) -> str:
    ... # Ellipsis indicates no implementation here

@overload
def process_data(data: list[int]) -> int:
    ...

def process_data(data): # Actual implementation
    if isinstance(data, str):
        return data.upper()
    elif isinstance(data, list):
        return sum(data)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported data type")

print(process_data("hello"))       # Static checker expects str, gets str
print(process_data([1, 2, 3]))     # Static checker expects int, gets int
print(process_data(123))           # Static checker would flag this as error
```

### `@override`

Introduced in **Python 3.12 (PEP 698)**, the `@override` decorator is a powerful tool for clarity and preventing common bugs in inheritance. When applied to a method in a subclass, it explicitly signals that this method is intended to override a method in one of its superclasses.

Its primary benefit is for **static analysis and early error detection**. If a method decorated with `@override` does not actually override a method with the same name and a compatible signature in any of its base classes, a static type checker will flag this as an error. This prevents subtle bugs that arise from typos in method names, changes in base class APIs, or incorrect assumptions about the inheritance hierarchy, which might otherwise only manifest as runtime `AttributeError`s or unexpected behavior. It effectively acts as a contract that improves code robustness and maintainability, making the intent of method overriding explicit.

```python
from typing import override # Requires Python 3.12+

class Base:
    def greet(self) -> str:
        return "Hello from Base"

class Sub(Base):
    @override
    def greet(self) -> str:
        return "Hello from Sub"

    @override
    def gret(self) -> str: # Static checker would error: No matching method in superclass
        return "Typo method"
```

#### General Modern Class Design Principles

Beyond specific decorators, several general principles guide modern Python class design:

- **Favor Composition Over Inheritance**: While inheritance is fundamental, overusing deep or complex inheritance hierarchies can lead to fragile base class problems. Often, it's better to build complex functionality by composing objects (an object having another object as an attribute) rather than inheriting. This promotes looser coupling and greater flexibility.
- **Encapsulation and Naming Conventions**: Python doesn't have strict private keywords. Instead, it relies on naming conventions:
  - `_attribute_name`: (Single leading underscore) Suggests a "protected" or "internal use only" attribute. Users _can_ still access it, but it signals that it's not part of the public API and might change.
  - `__attribute_name`: (Double leading underscore) Triggers "name mangling" (e.g., `_ClassName__attribute_name`). This makes it harder, but not impossible, to access from outside the class, offering a stronger form of encapsulation often used to prevent name clashes in inheritance.
- **Readability and Simplicity**: Strive for clear, readable code. Avoid overly clever or overly complex solutions when a simpler, more direct approach suffices. Python's dynamism is a strength, but it should be used judiciously.
- **Type Hinting Consistency**: Maintain consistent and accurate type hints throughout your class definitions. This is crucial for leveraging static analysis tools and for documenting your class's intended usage.

## Key Takeaways

- **Classes are Objects**: In Python, classes themselves are objects, and their type (their metaclass) is `type` by default. This concept allows for metaprogramming.
- **Instance vs. Class Attributes**: Understand the crucial difference between attributes unique to each object instance and those shared by all instances of a class. Modifying a class attribute via an instance name can shadow the class attribute by creating a new instance attribute.
- **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the order in which methods are searched in inheritance hierarchies, especially with multiple inheritance. `ClassName.mro()` reveals this order.
- **`super()` and MRO**: The `super()` function correctly delegates method calls according to the MRO, ensuring proper initialization and method invocation across complex inheritance trees.
- **Dunder Methods (Data Model)**: Special methods like `__init__`, `__new__`, `__str__`, `__add__`, `__getitem__`, etc., are the hooks that define an object's behavior and how it interacts with Python's built-in operations.
- **Name Mangling**: Prefixing an attribute with double underscores triggers name mangling, making it harder to access from outside the class. This is a convention for indicating "private" attributes.
- **Dynamic Class Creation**: Classes can be created programmatically at runtime using the `type()` constructor (e.g., `type('ClassName', bases, dict)`).
- **Custom Metaclasses**: For highly advanced scenarios, custom metaclasses (classes inheriting from `type`) allow developers to control and customize the class creation process itself.
- **Slotted Classes**: Using `__slots__` can optimize memory usage for classes with a fixed set of attributes, avoiding the overhead of a `__dict__` for each instance.
- **Dataclasses**: Introduced in Python 3.7, `dataclasses` provide a concise way to define classes primarily used for storing data, automatically generating common methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__` based on type annotations.
- **Class Decorators**: Decorators like `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and `@property` enhance class design by allowing methods to be defined with specific behaviors.
