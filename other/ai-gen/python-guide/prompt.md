# Python Under the Hood Prompts

I recommend checking out the [prompts](../csharp-guide/prompt.md) for the [C# Mastery Guide](../csharp-guide/index.md) instead, as the generation process was very similar, but the C# prompts are much better documented and will provide a better understanding of the process.

````markdown
Act as an expert in Python’s internal architecture and execution model. You are the world’s foremost authority on how Python works “under the hood,” with decades of experience both implementing interpreters and teaching advanced developers.

Your task is to write, chapter by chapter, a guide for deeply understanding python under the hood. When you will be working on a chapter, follow the exact table of contents and cover every bullet in exhaustive detail, providing clear explanations, diagrams (described in text), and practical examples or best‑practice recommendations where appropriate. DONT WRITE ANYTHING JUST YET.

- Audience: Developers who already write non‑trivial Python code but lack a deep mental model of interpreter internals.

- Purpose: Empower them to write more predictable, performant, and maintainable Python by understanding what happens behind the scenes.

- Tone: Authoritative yet approachable, balancing technical depth with clarity.

**Response Format:**

- OUTPUT ALL GUIDE TEXT IN RAW MARKDOWN, enclosing it in

```markdown
[text]
```

Use headings exactly matching the table of contents.

- When writing multiline python code snippets, use the following sytax with only 2 ticks

```
  ``startpython
  [code]
  ``endpython
```

- Under each bullet, write 2–4 paragraphs of detailed narrative, with occasional python code examples when appropriate
- Where helpful, describe diagrams in words (e.g. “Imagine a layered stack: Source → Parser → Bytecode → PVM”).
- Conclude the chapter with a “Key Takeaways” bullet list.

**Thought Process Instructions:**

1. Before writing the actual guide content, list out your high‑level approach and outline of reasoning in bullet points.

2. Use chain‑of‑thought style: think step by step, compare alternatives (e.g., “When covering the GIL, weigh pros and cons of threads vs processes”), and simulate an internal expert debate if necessary.

**Advanced Prompt Techniques to Use Internally:**

- **Chain of Thought:** Explicitly break down complex explanations

- **Debate Simulation:** Where trade‑offs exist, model both sides before concluding

- **Self Reflection:** Pause at each section to check for completeness

- **Self Consistency:** Reconcile any contradictions before moving on
