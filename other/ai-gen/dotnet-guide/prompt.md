# .NET Ecosystem Explained Prompts

## First a Conversation with ChatGTP

```markdown
Act as a senior .NET ecosystem expert with deep knowledge of the evolution, architecture, and use cases of all major .NET technologies, including .NET Framework, .NET Core, .NET Standard, and the .NET SDK. You are writing for an audience of intermediate to advanced developers who are familiar with programming in .NET, but may not fully understand the distinctions and historical transitions between these terms.

**Task:**

Explain the differences between **.NET Standard**, **.NET Core**, **.NET Framework**, and **.NET SDK**. Your explanation should be precise, technically accurate, and easy to follow for a developer who wants to understand how these terms relate to each other in practice and historically. Cover how each of these components has evolved, what purpose each one serves, and how they interoperate (or don’t) with each other.

**Context:**

Many developers, especially those entering the modern .NET ecosystem, are confused by overlapping or evolving terminology. This confusion is compounded by the convergence into .NET 5 and later. The reader wants a clear mental model for how these four terms differ, how they fit into the broader .NET ecosystem, and when each is relevant in real-world development scenarios.

**Instructions:**

- Before answering, list your reasoning steps so the reader understands how you're approaching the breakdown.
- Think step by step. Build the explanation incrementally and logically.
- Use **Chain of Thought** reasoning to break complex ideas into digestible parts.
- Where applicable, use contrast tables or analogies to clarify conceptual differences.
- Include clear **version history notes** for each term (e.g., when it was introduced, deprecated, or merged).
- Highlight practical use cases and compatibility boundaries.
- End with a **summary table** that concisely compares the four terms across dimensions such as purpose, runtime, platform compatibility, and current relevance.

**Response Format:**

1. **Reasoning Steps**
2. **Individual Explanations**

   - .NET Framework
   - .NET Core
   - .NET Standard
   - .NET SDK

3. **How They Relate or Differ**
4. **Timeline and Versioning Notes**
5. **Use Cases and Guidance**
6. **Summary Comparison Table**

## At the end of ChatGTP conversation

- I would like to compile this entire conversation we had into a single PDF file. But first I would like you to suggest a table of contents of the PDF, so that the topics nutally flow one into the other (are discussed in logical order) and everything we touched on is explained
```

## Asking ChatGTP to create a prompt for Gemini

```markdown
You are an expert prompt engineer. Your task is to deeply understand what I want, and in return respond with a well crafted prompt that, if fed to a separate AI, will get me exactly the result I want.

The prompt follows this rough outline, and makes sure to include each part as needed:

1. A persona. At the start, you write something to the affect of "Act as an expert in ..." This primes the LLM to respond from info relating to experts in the specific field.
2. The task. This part of the prompt involves exhaustively laying out the task for the LLM. It is critical this part is specific and clear. This is the most important part of the prompt.
3. Context. Make sure to include _any_ context that is needed for the LLM to accurately, and reliably respond as needed.
4. Response format. Outline the ideal response format for this prompt.
5. Examples. This step is optional, but if examples would be beneficial, include them.

Some other important notes:

- Instruct the model to list out it's thoughts before giving an answer.
- If complex reasoning is required, include directions for the LLM to think step by step, and weigh all sides of the topic before settling on an answer.
- Where appropriate, make sure to utilize advanced prompt engineering techniques. These include, but are not limited to: Chain of Thought, Debate simulations, Self Reflection, and Self Consistency.
- Strictly use text, no code please

Please craft the perfect prompt for my request below

Write a .NET guide. Suggested table of contents:

(table of contents is the same as in the next section)
```

## Prompt for Gemini

```markdown
Act as an expert in the design and delivery of technical guides for intermediate to advanced .NET developers.

Task:

You will produce a comprehensive, structured guide titled “.NET Ecosystem Explained,” matching the detailed table of contents below. Your guide must be clear, authoritative, and richly detailed, suitable for readers who already have hands‑on .NET experience and want to deepen their mental model of the platform.

Context:

The guide should follow this precise outline and cover every bullet point under each heading. Use diagrams or ASCII art where helpful (e.g., to show SDK/runtime relationships). Wherever complex concepts arise (CIL, CLR internals, GC, AOT vs JIT), think through the explanation step by step, weigh trade‑offs, and simulate internal debate (e.g., “Argument A: …; Argument B: …; Resolution: …”). After your internal reasoning, present the final polished section. Incorporate Chain‑of‑Thought prompts, self‑reflection (“Have I covered all compatibility scenarios?”), and self‑consistency checks (“Do my examples match earlier definitions?”).

Response Format:

Thoughts: A numbered list of your private reasoning steps before writing any section.

Final Guide:

Use the exact section and subsection numbering/headers.

Under each header, write 2–4 paragraphs explaining the topic.

Include code snippets (C# → CIL) where indicated.

Provide a visual summary in section 6 (ASCII diagram + summary table).

Conclude each major section with “Key Takeaways.”

Self‑Reflection: A brief note at the end evaluating coverage and clarity.
