# Unit 2: First Steps & Basic Sentences (Les Premiers Pas)

You've got the sounds under your belt (mostly!). Now it's time to put those sounds into action and start having your very first basic conversations. This unit is all about introducing yourself, saying hello, saying goodbye, and talking about what you have. These are the bricks and mortar of everyday chats!

---

## Lesson 4: Greetings & Goodbyes (Les Salutations)

**Thoughts:** This lesson is super practical. You'll learn how to say hi and bye in various situations. The most important concept here is **formal vs. informal address** – a social rule crucial in French, similar in concept to how you address people in Czech, but specifically using "you."

**Casual Introduction:** Imagine walking into a café in Prague (or Paris!). What's the first thing you say? "Dobrý den!" or "Hello!" In French, it's just as simple, but there are a few important nuances. Are you talking to a friend, a shopkeeper, or your grandmother? The French have different ways to say "you," and it changes how you greet someone. Let's learn to make a great first impression!

### Essential Greetings (Les Salutations essentielles)

Here are the most common ways to say hello and goodbye:

- **Bonjour !** (Bohn-ZHOOR) - Hello / Good day.
  - _Thoughts:_ This is your universal, go-to greeting during the day. Use it almost anywhere, with anyone, from morning until about 6 PM.
- **Bonsoir !** (Bohn-SWAHR) - Good evening.
  - _Thoughts:_ Use this from late afternoon/early evening onwards.
- **Bonne nuit !** (BUN NWEE) - Good night.
  - _Thoughts:_ This is only used when you are _going to bed_ or saying goodbye to someone who is going to bed. Not a general evening greeting.
- **Salut !** (Sah-LEW) - Hi / Bye.
  - _Thoughts:_ This is super informal, like "Hi" or "Hey" in English. Only use it with friends, family, or people your age you know well. Never with a stranger or someone older/in a position of authority!
- **Au revoir !** (Oh ruh-VWAHR) - Goodbye.
  - _Thoughts:_ Your universal goodbye, for formal and informal situations.
- **À bientôt !** (Ah byahn-TOH) - See you soon!
  - _Thoughts:_ Used when you expect to see the person again relatively soon.
- **À tout à l'heure !** (Ah toot ah LUHR) - See you later (today)!
  - _Thoughts:_ More specific than _À bientôt_, implies seeing them later the same day.

### Asking How Someone Is

After "Hello," you often ask "How are you?"

- **Ça va ?** (Sah VAH?) - How are you? / How's it going?
  - _Thoughts:_ This is the most common, very casual way. Literally "It goes?"
- **Ça va.** (Sah VAH.) - I'm fine. / It's going well.
  - _Thoughts:_ The answer is often the same as the question!
- **Ça va bien.** (Sah VAH byahn) - I'm doing well.
- **Et toi ?** (Eh TWAH?) - And you? (Informal)
- **Et vous ?** (Eh VOO?) - And you? (Formal / Plural)

**Example Dialogue 1 (Informal):**

**Anna:** Salut, Tomáš ! (Hi, Tomáš!)
**Tomáš:** Salut, Anna ! Ça va ? (Hi, Anna! How's it going?)
**Anna:** Ça va bien, merci. Et toi ? (I'm doing well, thanks. And you?)
**Tomáš:** Ça va. À bientôt ! (I'm fine. See you soon!)
**Anna:** À bientôt ! (See you soon!)

**Example Dialogue 2 (Formal):**

**Client:** Bonjour, Madame ! (Hello, Madam!)
**Vendeur:** Bonjour, Monsieur. Ça va ? (Hello, Sir. How are you?)
**Client:** Ça va, merci. Et vous ? (I'm fine, thanks. And you?)
**Vendeur:** Ça va bien, merci. Au revoir ! (I'm doing well, thank you. Goodbye!)
**Client:** Au revoir ! (Goodbye!)

### Grammar Spotlight: Tu vs. Vous – The Two "Yous"

This is one of the most important distinctions in French social etiquette. English just has "you," but French (like Czech, sort of!) has two ways to say it:

- **Tu** (too) - This is the **informal, singular "you."**
  - Use _tu_ with:
    - Friends
    - Family members
    - Children
    - Animals
    - People your age or younger, _if_ you've agreed to be informal (sometimes indicated by using first names).
  - Think of it like when you use someone's first name in Czech, or informal address within family.
- **Vous** (voo) - This is the **formal, singular "you"** AND the **plural "you"** (for any group of people).
  - Use _vous_ with:
    - Strangers
    - People older than you (unless they invite you to use _tu_)
    - People in positions of authority (teachers, police, doctors, shopkeepers, etc.)
    - Any group of two or more people, even if they are your friends.
  - Think of it like the Czech concept of _vykání_ when addressing an elder or stranger politely, even if the grammatical mechanics are different. And of course, _vy_ for multiple people.

**Why is this important?** Using _tu_ when you should use _vous_ can be seen as disrespectful or rude. When in doubt, **always use _vous_**. It's better to be too polite than not polite enough. If someone wants you to use _tu_, they'll usually tell you: "_On peut se tutoyer._" (We can use _tu_ with each other.)

### Cultural Note: When to Use 'Tu' vs. 'Vous'

In France, the _tu/vous_ distinction is deeply ingrained in social interactions. It's more than just grammar; it's a sign of respect, familiarity, and social distance.

- **Initial encounters:** Always start with _vous_ when meeting someone new, especially adults.
- **Age and Authority:** Generally, you use _vous_ with anyone significantly older than you or in a professional/authoritative role (teachers, doctors, shop assistants, waiters, etc.), unless they explicitly suggest otherwise.
- **Professional settings:** Even among colleagues, _vous_ is often the default, at least initially.
- **Younger generation:** Younger people (under 30) tend to switch to _tu_ more quickly among themselves, but it's still good practice to start with _vous_ with a new acquaintance until familiarity is established.
- **Czech Parallel:** While Czech doesn't have two distinct "you" pronouns, you understand the social nuances of addressing people differently (e.g., _pan/paní_ + surname for formality, or different verb endings). The _feeling_ of formality/informality is something you're familiar with, even if the French system is pronoun-based.

### Exercises/Quiz:

1.  **Translate these greetings into French:**
    - a) Good day (universal)
    - b) Hi (informal)
    - c) Goodbye (universal)
    - d) See you soon!
2.  **You're speaking to:**
    - i) Your best friend: Should you use _tu_ or _vous_?
    - ii) A stranger at a shop: Should you use _tu_ or _vous_?
    - iii) Your French teacher: Should you use _tu_ or _vous_?
    - iv) A group of your friends: Should you use _tu_ or _vous_?
3.  **Fill in the blanks with the correct "you" pronoun:**
    - a) Salut, Marie! Ça va? Et **\_\_** ? (talking to your sister)
    - b) Bonjour, Monsieur Martin. Ça va bien, merci. Et **\_\_** ? (talking to your boss)
    - c) Au revoir les enfants ! À bientôt ! (talking to a group of children)

### Solutions:

1.  a) Bonjour! b) Salut! c) Au revoir! d) À bientôt!
2.  i) tu, ii) vous, iii) vous, iv) vous
3.  a) toi, b) vous, c) vous

## Lesson 5: Introducing Yourself with être (Se présenter avec être)

**Thoughts:** This is a crucial step! We're learning the most fundamental verb in French, _être_ ("to be"), and the words that stand in for names: **subject pronouns** (I, you, he, she, etc.). You'll be able to say "I am [your name]" and "He is [his name]!"

**Casual Introduction:** After saying hello, the next natural step in a conversation is usually introducing yourself or someone else. To do that, we need the "to be" verb. In French, this verb is super important, but also a bit... special. It's called _être_. It changes its form depending on who "is" doing the "being." Don't worry, we'll make it clear!

### Subject Pronouns (Les pronoms sujets)

These are the words that replace nouns (people, places, things) and tell us who is doing the action. They are the "I, you, he, she, we, they" of French.

| French Pronoun | English Translation             | Notes                                   |
| :------------- | :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Je**         | I                               | J' before a vowel (e.g., _j'ai_)        |
| **Tu**         | You (informal, singular)        |                                         |
| **Il**         | He / It (masculine)             |                                         |
| **Elle**       | She / It (feminine)             |                                         |
| **On**         | We / One / People (generally)   | Very common in informal French for "we" |
| **Nous**       | We (formal, plural)             | More formal than _on_ for "we"          |
| **Vous**       | You (formal, singular / plural) |                                         |
| **Ils**        | They (masculine / mixed group)  | For two or more males, or mixed gender  |
| **Elles**      | They (feminine)                 | For two or more females only            |

- **Czech Connection:** You're familiar with these concepts in Czech: _já, ty, on, ona, my, vy, oni, ony_. The French set is similar!

### Grammar Spotlight: The Verb ÊTRE (To be)

_Être_ is one of the two most important verbs in French. It's "irregular," meaning it doesn't follow a simple pattern. You'll need to memorize its forms, but don't worry, you'll use it so often, it'll become second nature!

**ÊTRE - Present Tense Conjugation**

| Subject Pronoun | ÊTRE Form  | English Equivalent |
| :-------------- | :--------- | :----------------- |
| **Je**          | **suis**   | I am               |
| **Tu**          | **es**     | You are            |
| **Il**          | **est**    | He is              |
| **Elle**        | **est**    | She is             |
| **On**          | **est**    | One is / We are    |
| **Nous**        | **sommes** | We are             |
| **Vous**        | **êtes**   | You are            |
| **Ils**         | **sont**   | They are           |
| **Elles**       | **sont**   | They are           |

**Pronunciation Notes:**

- Notice the silent final 's' on _suis_ and _es_.
- _Est_ sounds like "eh," and the 't' is silent.
- _Sont_ sounds like the nasal 'on' (from Lesson 2) with a 's' at the beginning, the 't' is silent.
- **Liaison Alert!** When _vous_ or _nous_ are followed by a verb starting with a vowel, the final 's' is pronounced like a 'z' sound. So, _vous êtes_ sounds like "voo-ZET." _Nous sommes_ has no liaison because _sommes_ starts with a consonant.

### Introducing Yourself and Others

Now, let's put it together!

**To say "I am [your name]":**

- **Je suis** [Your Name]. (Juh SWEE [Your Name].)
  - _Example:_ Je suis Anna. (I am Anna.)
  - _Example:_ Je suis Tomáš. (I am Tomáš.)

**To ask "Who is it? / What is it?":**

- **Qui est-ce ?** (KEE ES?) - Who is it? (Literally "Who is this?")
- **C'est...** (Seh...) - It is... / This is...
  - _Thoughts:_ _C'est_ is super useful! It's how you identify people or things.
  - _Example:_ C'est Marie. (It is Marie. / This is Marie.)
  - _Example:_ C'est mon ami. (It is my friend. / This is my friend.)

**Introducing others:**

- **Il est** [Name/Description]. (EEL eh) - He is...
  - _Example:_ Il est Pierre. (He is Pierre.)
  - _Example:_ Il est étudiant. (He is a student - masculine.)
- **Elle est** [Name/Description]. (EL eh) - She is...
  - _Example:_ Elle est Sophie. (She is Sophie.)
  - _Example:_ Elle est étudiante. (She is a student - feminine.)

**Example Dialogue:**

**Marie:** Salut, Pierre !
**Pierre:** Salut, Marie ! Qui est-ce ? (Who is this?)
**Marie:** C'est Anna. Elle est de Prague. (This is Anna. She is from Prague.)
**Pierre:** Bonjour, Anna. Je suis Pierre. (Hello, Anna. I am Pierre.)
**Anna:** Bonjour, Pierre.

| :------------------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Je suis              | I am                         |                                |
| Tu es                | You are (informal)           |                                |
| Il est               | He is / It is (masc.)        |                                |
| Elle est             | She is / It is (fem.)        |                                |
| On est               | We are / One is / People are | Informal "we"                  |

| C'est                | It is / This is              | Very common for identification |
| de                   | from / of                    |                                |
| étudiant / étudiante | student (m/f)                |                                |
| ami / amie           | friend (m/f)                 |                                |

### Cultural Note: Politeness in Introductions

In French culture, when introducing yourself or others, a simple "Bonjour" or "Bonsoir" accompanied by a firm handshake (or _bise_ - a light kiss on the cheek, which is a whole other cultural note for later!) is standard. Always make eye contact. Being direct is fine, but politeness (using _vous_ initially, saying _merci_) is key.

## Lesson 6: Talking About What You Have with avoir (Parler de ce qu'on a avec avoir)

**Thoughts:** Time for our second superstar verb: _avoir_ ("to have"). You'll learn how to talk about possessions, but also some surprising things like age and certain feelings – this is where French (and Czech!) differs from English.

**Casual Introduction:** What do you have? A pen? A cat? A good idea? In French, we use the verb _avoir_ to talk about possession. But _avoir_ is a multi-talented verb! It's also used for your age (you _have_ years, you don't _are_ years) and even some basic physical states. Let's explore _avoir_!

### Grammar Spotlight: The Verb AVOIR (To have)

Like _être_, _avoir_ is super important and irregular. Memorize its forms!

**AVOIR - Present Tense Conjugation**

| Subject Pronoun | AVOIR Form | English Equivalent |
| :-------------- | :--------- | :----------------- |
| **Je**          | **ai**     | I have             |
| **Tu**          | **as**     | You have           |
| **Il**          | **a**      | He has             |
| **Elle**        | **a**      | She has            |
| **On**          | **a**      | One has / We have  |
| **Nous**        | **avons**  | We have            |
| **Vous**        | **avez**   | You have           |
| **Ils**         | **ont**    | They have          |
| **Elles**       | **ont**    | They have          |

**Pronunciation Notes:**

- **J'ai** (ZHAY) - The 'e' in 'je' disappears before a vowel. This is called **elision**.
- **Tu as** (too AH) - No silent 's' here! The 's' links to the vowel.
- **Il a** (eel AH) - No liaison here because 'il' ends in 'l', not 's' or 't'.
- **Nous avons** (noo-ZAH-vohn) - The 's' of _nous_ links to the 'a' of _avons_, making a 'z' sound (**liaison**).
- **Vous avez** (voo-ZAH-vay) - Same as _nous avons_, liaison with 'z' sound.
- **Ils ont** (eel-ZOHN) / **Elles ont** (el-ZOHN) - Liaison with 'z' sound. Also, _ont_ uses the nasal 'on' sound (from Lesson 2!).

### Using AVOIR

#### 1. To Express Possession (What you _have_)

- **J'ai** un livre. (Jhay un LEEVR) - I have a book.
- **Tu as** une voiture. (Too ah oon VWAT-yur) - You have a car.
- **Il a** un chien. (Eel ah un SHYEN) - He has a dog.
- **Elle a** une idée. (El ah oon EE-day) - She has an idea.
- **Nous avons** une maison. (Noo-ZAH-vohn oon MAY-zohn) - We have a house.
- **Vous avez** un chat. (Voo-ZAH-vay un SHAH) - You have a cat.
- **Ils ont** des amis. (Eel-ZOHN day-ZAH-mee) - They have friends.

#### 2. To Express Age (How old you _are_)

In French, you _have_ years, you don't _are_ years! This is similar to Czech, where you use _mít_ (to have) for age.

- **J'ai** 30 **ans**. (Jhay TRAHNT ZAHN) - I am 30 years old. (Literally: I have 30 years.)
- **Tu as** 25 **ans**. (Too ah VANGT-sank ZAHN) - You are 25 years old.
- **Il a** 40 **ans**. (Eel ah KAH-rahnt ZAHN) - He is 40 years old.

- **Czech Connection:** This is great news for you! In Czech, you say "_Mám 30 let_" (I have 30 years). So the concept is identical: **French _avoir_ = Czech _mít_ for age.** This will feel very natural!

#### 3. To Express Certain Feelings or States

This is another difference from English, where you might say "I _am_ hungry." In French, you _have_ hunger!

- **J'ai faim.** (Jhay FANG) - I am hungry. (Literally: I have hunger.)
- **Tu as soif.** (Too ah SWAHF) - You are thirsty. (Literally: You have thirst.)
- **Il a chaud.** (Eel ah SHOH) - He is hot. (Literally: He has hot.)
- **Elle a froid.** (El ah FRWAH) - She is cold. (Literally: She has cold.)
- **Nous avons sommeil.** (Noo-ZAH-vohn SOH-may) - We are sleepy. (Literally: We have sleep.)
- **Vous avez peur.** (Voo-ZAH-vay PUHR) - You are afraid. (Literally: You have fear.)

**Example Dialogue:**

**Jean:** Salut Marie ! Ça va ? (Hi Marie! How's it going?)
**Marie:** Ça va bien, merci. J'ai faim ! Et toi ? (I'm doing well, thanks. I'm hungry! And you?)
**Jean:** Moi, ça va. Tu as quel âge ? (Me, I'm fine. How old are you? - Lit: You have what age?)
**Marie:** J'ai vingt-cinq ans. Et toi ? (I'm twenty-five. And you?)
**Jean:** J'ai trente ans. (I'm thirty.)
**Marie:** Ah, tu as un chien, non ? (Ah, you have a dog, right?)
**Jean:** Oui, j'ai un chien ! (Yes, I have a dog!)

### Key Takeaways for Unit 2: First Steps & Basic Sentences

- **Greetings:** Use **Bonjour** (day), **Bonsoir** (evening), **Au revoir** (goodbye). **Salut** is informal.
- **Asking how someone is:** **Ça va?** (casual) and **Ça va.** for the answer. Use **Et toi?** (informal) or **Et vous?** (formal/plural) to ask back.
- **Tu vs. Vous:** This is crucial!
  - **Tu:** Informal, singular (friends, family, kids).
  - **Vous:** Formal, singular (strangers, elders, authority figures) AND _always_ plural. When in doubt, use _vous_.
- **Verb ÊTRE (to be):**
  - _Je suis, Tu es, Il/Elle/On est, Nous sommes, Vous êtes, Ils/Elles sont._
  - Used for identity ("Je suis Anna") and descriptions.
  - Remember **C'est** (It is/This is) for identification.
- **Verb AVOIR (to have):**
  - _J'ai, Tu as, Il/Elle/On a, Nous avons, Vous avez, Ils/Elles ont._
  - Used for **possession** ("J'ai un livre").
  - Used for **age** ("J'ai 30 ans" - I have 30 years, just like Czech _mít_).
  - Used for certain **feelings/states** ("J'ai faim" - I have hunger / I am hungry).
- **Pronunciation:** Continue practicing the nasal sounds and remember **liaison** (linking sounds) with `nous avons` and `vous avez`. Also, **elision** (dropping a vowel) with `j'ai`.
