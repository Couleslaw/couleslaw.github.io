## Chapter 6. Model Selection and Parameter Tuning

Model selection is the process of choosing the best performing model and the optimal set of hyperparameters for that model. In scikit-learn, this is achieved by leveraging **meta-estimators** like `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`. These tools use **cross-validation (CV)** to systematically search the hyperparameter space while maintaining experimental rigor.

The integration of these search tools with the `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` (Chapters 4 and 5) creates the most powerful architectural pattern in scikit-learn. This chapter details the mechanics of hyperparameter search, emphasizing the critical role of parameter namespacing and ensuring cross-validation correctness to prevent data leakage.

## Section 6.1. Parameter Namespacing

This section revisits and details the double-underscore convention, which is the foundational language used to communicate hyperparameters across nested estimators during the tuning process.

### How parameter names propagate via `__`

The ability to tune parameters across a multi-step workflow (e.g., scaling strategy, feature degree, and regularization strength) relies entirely on the **namespacing convention** established by `BaseEstimator`'s `get_params()` and `set_params()` methods.

When a meta-estimator like `GridSearchCV` receives a `Pipeline` or `ColumnTransformer`, it calls `get_params(deep=True)` to create a flattened dictionary of every available parameter. The keys in this dictionary use the double-underscore (`__`) delimiter to denote the path from the outermost estimator to the inner parameter.

**The `GridSearchCV` Process:**

1.  **Read Search Space:** The user provides a `param_grid` dictionary where keys are the namespaced parameters (e.g., `'pca__n_components'`).
2.  **Iterate and Clone:** For each combination of parameters, `GridSearchCV` creates a clean, unfitted copy using `clone()`.
3.  **Set Parameters:** It calls `clone.set_params()` using the current namespaced keys and values.
4.  **Execute Fit:** It calls `clone.fit(X_train_fold, y_train_fold)`.

The `set_params` method inside the pipeline recursively navigates the step names provided before the `__` until it finds the correct inner estimator and sets the final parameter (the name after the last `__`).

| Estimator Path                                                                                | Step Names                             | Parameter   | Namespaced Key (for tuning)              |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :---------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `Pipeline` $\rightarrow$ `StandardScaler`                                                     | `'scaler'`                             | `with_mean` | `'scaler__with_mean'`                    |
| `Pipeline` $\rightarrow$ `ColumnTransformer` $\rightarrow$ `Pipeline` $\rightarrow$ `Imputer` | `'preprocessor'`, `'num'`, `'imputer'` | `strategy`  | `'preprocessor__num__imputer__strategy'` |
| `Pipeline` $\rightarrow$ `RandomForest`                                                       | `'clf'`                                | `max_depth` | `'clf__max_depth'`                       |

**Practical Pitfall:** Parameter tuning will silently fail if the namespaced key does not exactly match the path to a defined parameter in the `__init__` signature of the target estimator.

## Section 6.2. Grid Search Basics

This section explains the mechanics of `GridSearchCV`, the canonical tool for exhaustive hyperparameter search, and its integration with the cross-validation workflow.

### `GridSearchCV` and cross-validation workflow

**`GridSearchCV`** performs an **exhaustive search** over a specified set of parameter values (a "grid"). For every combination of hyperparameters:

1.  It iterates over the $K$ folds defined by the cross-validation strategy (e.g., `KFold`, `StratifiedKFold`).
2.  In each iteration, it trains the model on $K-1$ folds (training set) and evaluates it on the remaining 1 fold (validation set).
3.  The performance metric (the `score()` output or a specified `scoring` function) is recorded.
4.  The results across all $K$ folds are averaged to give a robust estimate of the model's performance for that parameter combination.

The best parameter set is the one that yielded the highest average score across the CV folds.

**Key Hyperparameters:**

- `estimator`: The model or `Pipeline` object to be tuned.
- `param_grid`: The dictionary defining the search space using `__` namespacing.
- `cv`: The cross-validation splitting strategy (e.g., `cv=5` for 5-fold CV).
- `scoring`: The metric used to evaluate performance (e.g., `'accuracy'`, `'r2'`, `'neg_mean_squared_error'`).

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

X, y = make_classification(n_samples=200, random_state=42)
estimator = SVC(random_state=42)

# Define the grid
param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10],       # Regularization parameter
    'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf'] # Kernel function
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=estimator,
    param_grid=param_grid,
    cv=4,
    scoring='accuracy',
    n_jobs=-1 # Use all available cores for parallel search
)

# Fit executes 3 * 2 * 4 = 24 total fits
grid_search.fit(X, y)
print(f"Total fits performed: {len(grid_search.cv_results_['params']) * 4}")
print(f"Best parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}")
```

## Section 6.3. Randomized Search

This section introduces `RandomizedSearchCV` as an efficient alternative to exhaustive grid search when the hyperparameter space is very large.

### Efficiency tradeoffs and distributions

When the number of hyperparameters and their possible values is large, `GridSearchCV` quickly becomes computationally infeasible due to its exponential complexity. **`RandomizedSearchCV`** addresses this by sampling a fixed number of parameter combinations from the specified search space.

- **Tradeoff:** Instead of exhaustively testing every point, it tests a fixed number (`n_iter`) of randomly selected points. This is often more efficient for finding a good (though not necessarily optimal) set of parameters, especially in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Search Space:** The search space for `RandomizedSearchCV` is defined using a dictionary called `param_distributions`. Values in this dictionary are not fixed lists but often **statistical distributions** from `scipy.stats` (e.g., `uniform`, `loguniform`, `randint`).

Using statistical distributions allows the search to explore potentially infinite ranges of parameters, directing more sampling effort toward promising regions than an equally spaced grid.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from scipy.stats import loguniform
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

X, y = make_classification(n_samples=200, random_state=42)
estimator = GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=42)

# Define the distribution for sampling
param_distributions = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 500],
    # Sample learning_rate from a log-uniform distribution between 0.01 and 0.5
    'learning_rate': loguniform(0.01, 0.5),
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7]
}

random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    estimator=estimator,
    param_distributions=param_distributions,
    n_iter=20, # Only perform 20 random trials (20 fits * cv)
    cv=4,
    random_state=42
)

# RandomizedSearchCV will execute 20 * 4 = 80 fits (significantly fewer than an exhaustive search)
random_search.fit(X, y)
print(f"Total iterations performed: {random_search.n_iter}")
print(f"Best sampled parameters: {random_search.best_params_}")
```

## Section 6.4. Cross-Validation Correctness

This section emphasizes the crucial role of CV in preventing data leakage, specifically addressing the need for strict separation of the feature selection and model training processes.

### Preventing leakage through nested CV

The combination of `Pipeline` and `GridSearchCV` is designed to prevent data leakage by isolating the fitting process to the training folds.

**Data Leakage Scenario:** If you performed feature scaling or selection _before_ running `GridSearchCV` (e.g., calling `StandardScaler().fit_transform(X_full)`), the scaling statistics would be computed using the entire dataset, including the validation folds. This is leakage.

**The Correct Solution (Pipeline):** By placing the `StandardScaler` _inside_ the `Pipeline` and passing the `Pipeline` to `GridSearchCV`, the entire process is correctly nested:

1.  `GridSearchCV` splits $X$ into folds ($X_{train}$ and $X_{val}$).
2.  The `Pipeline` receives $X_{train}$.
3.  The `StandardScaler` inside the pipeline calls `fit_transform(X_{train})`, learning its parameters **only** from $X_{train}$.
4.  When evaluating on $X_{val}$, the `Pipeline` ensures the `StandardScaler` calls **only** `transform(X_{val})` using the parameters learned in step 3.

This is the principle of **nested cross-validation** correctness, ensuring that the model selection and evaluation processes are statistically sound.

## Section 6.5. Extracting Best Estimator

This section details how to retrieve the final, optimized model and access the fitted parameters of its internal components.

### Accessing inner steps from `best_estimator_`

After `GridSearchCV.fit()` completes, the best performing model (the one that achieved the highest CV score) is automatically refitted on the **entire input dataset $X$** and stored in the **`best_estimator_`** attribute.

This object is the final, production-ready model. Since the `best_estimator_` is a fully fitted `Pipeline` or `ColumnTransformer`, all the learned parameters of its internal steps are available via the `named_steps_` attribute, allowing for post-analysis and interpretation.

```python
# Assuming 'grid_search' from the previous example is fitted
best_clf_pipeline = grid_search.best_estimator_

# The pipeline itself is now fitted and ready for prediction
test_prediction = best_clf_pipeline.predict(X[0].reshape(1, -1))

# Accessing the internal parameters of the best model:

# 1. Access the best SVC step inside the Pipeline
best_svc = best_clf_pipeline.named_steps['svc']
# Note: if using make_pipeline, the name will be lowercase: 'svc'

# 2. Inspect the learned state (fitted attributes)
print(f"\nBest SVC Support Vector Count (n_support_): {best_svc.n_support_}")

# 3. Inspect the final best hyperparameters
print(f"Best SVC C parameter: {best_svc.C}")
```

**Insight:** If the `best_estimator_` is a `Pipeline` containing a `ColumnTransformer`, you access the nested transformers via a chained sequence of `named_steps` and `named_transformers_` lookups (e.g., `best_pipeline.named_steps['preprocessor'].named_transformers_['num']`).

## Code Lab

### Tune both preprocessing and model hyperparameters using a full pipeline.

This lab brings together the `Pipeline` and the tuning tool to optimize a complete classification workflow, tuning parameters on both a transformer and a predictor.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
import numpy as np

# 1. Prepare Data (introduce NaNs for imputation)
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=200, n_features=5, n_informative=3, random_state=42)
X[np.random.rand(*X.shape) < 0.1] = np.nan # Introduce 10% missing values
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42)

# 2. Define the Complete Pipeline
# Imputer (Transformer) -> Scaler (Transformer) -> Classifier (Predictor)
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(random_state=42)),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('clf', LogisticRegression(random_state=42))
])

# 3. Define the Search Grid (Tuning 3 hyperparameters across 3 steps)
param_grid = {
    # Imputer Hyperparameter
    'imputer__strategy': ['mean', 'median'],

    # Scaler Hyperparameter
    'scaler__with_std': [True, False],

    # Classifier Hyperparameter
    'clf__C': [0.5, 1.0, 10.0]
}

# 4. Perform Grid Search (2 * 2 * 3 = 12 combinations * 5 CV folds = 60 fits)
grid = GridSearchCV(
    pipeline,
    param_grid,
    cv=5,
    scoring='accuracy',
    n_jobs=-1
)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 5. Extract and Evaluate Best Estimator
best_pipeline = grid.best_estimator_

print("--- Final Evaluation ---")
print(f"Best CV Score: {grid.best_score_:.4f}")
print(f"Best Parameters: {grid.best_params_}")
print(f"Test Set Accuracy: {best_pipeline.score(X_test, y_test):.4f}")

# 6. Inspect Imputer strategy used in the final model
best_imputer_strategy = best_pipeline.named_steps['imputer'].strategy
print(f"Best Imputation Strategy: {best_imputer_strategy}")
```

## Deep Dive

### How `GridSearchCV` clones and fits pipelines behind the scenes.

The correctness of `GridSearchCV` and its ability to prevent data leakage rests on its meticulous management of estimator instances, enforced by the `clone()` function (Chapter 1).

**The Cloning and Fitting Loop:**

1.  **Outer Loop:** `GridSearchCV` starts its CV loop. It iterates over the parameter combinations and folds.
2.  **Cloning:** Before fitting any fold, it calls `cloned_estimator = clone(original_pipeline)`.
    - This deep-copies the **hyperparameters** (including all nested `random_state` parameters) of the pipeline and all its steps.
    - It critically ensures that the resulting `cloned_estimator` is **unfitted** (no `_`-suffixed attributes).
3.  **Parameter Injection:** `GridSearchCV` calls `cloned_estimator.set_params(**current_params)`, injecting the current parameter combination into the cloned pipeline using the `__` namespacing logic.
4.  **Fold Fitting:** The `cloned_estimator.fit(X_train_fold, y_train_fold)` is executed. The pipeline ensures that the `fit_transform` and `fit` steps use _only_ the data from the current training fold.
5.  **Scoring and Discard:** The model is scored on the validation fold, and the **entire fitted `cloned_estimator` is discarded** (garbage collected).

This processâ€”cloning, setting params, fitting, and discardingâ€”is repeated for _every single combination_ of parameters and _every single CV fold_. This rigorous isolation guarantees that the statistics learned in one fold (or one parameter combination) cannot influence any other, ensuring the statistical validity of the hyperparameter search result.

## Key Takeaways

The reader should now understand:

- **Hyperparameter tuning** in scikit-learn is achieved via meta-estimators like `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`.
- **Namespacing** via the **`__`** convention is mandatory for tuning parameters in pipelines and composite estimators.
- **`GridSearchCV`** performs an exhaustive search, while **`RandomizedSearchCV`** offers efficiency by sampling from statistical distributions.
- **Cross-Validation Correctness** is enforced by using the `Pipeline` as the estimator input to the search tool, preventing data leakage.
- The final optimized workflow is stored in **`best_estimator_`**, which can be inspected to retrieve the learned state and optimal settings of all internal components.

We have now covered the complete, rigorous workflow of preprocessing, modeling, and tuning. **Chapter 7. Advanced Transformer Mechanics** will return to custom components, teaching how to extend scikit-learn's functionality by creating bespoke transformers.

## Chapter 7. Advanced Transformer Mechanics

While scikit-learn provides a rich library of pre-built transformers, real-world projects often demand custom data preparation logicâ€”whether it's domain-specific scaling, complex feature engineering, or integration with external libraries. This chapter focuses on the advanced mechanics required to **create and integrate bespoke transformers** into the scikit-learn ecosystem.

We will detail the necessary inheritance from `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin`, examine the quick-utility of `FunctionTransformer`, and discuss essential considerations for robust design, including managing state, controlling output type (NumPy array vs. pandas DataFrame), and ensuring safe operation with sparse data. Mastering these techniques allows you to extend the unified API indefinitely.

## Section 7.1. Custom Transformers

In this section, we define the minimum requirements for creating a custom transformer that fully adheres to the scikit-learn API, enabling seamless integration into `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer`.

### Subclassing `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin`

To create a transformer that is compatible with scikit-learn's ecosystem (e.g., can be cloned, supports `get_params()`, and works in a `Pipeline`), it must inherit from two base classes:

1.  **`sklearn.base.BaseEstimator`**: Provides the foundational methods for hyperparameter management: `get_params()`, `set_params()`, and the constructor logic that stores all keyword arguments as attributes.
2.  **`sklearn.base.TransformerMixin`**: Automatically provides the default implementation of the convenience method `fit_transform()`, which simply calls `fit()` followed by `transform()` on the input data.

A custom transformer must then explicitly implement the following three methods:

- **`**init**(self, **kwargs)`**: Defines the transformer's hyperparameters and stores them as instance attributes (without the underscore `\_`).
- **`fit(self, X, y=None)`**: The learning phase. Calculates any necessary statistics or state from $X$ (e.g., mean, categories) and stores them as attributes with a trailing underscore (`_`). Must return `self`.
- **`transform(self, X)`**: The application phase. Applies the transformation using the fitted state (the `_` attributes) to the input $X$. Must return the transformed data, typically as a 2D array.

```python
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin
import numpy as np

class FeatureDropper(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """Drops specified columns by index."""
    def __init__(self, indices_to_drop):
        # Hyperparameters defined and stored
        self.indices_to_drop = indices_to_drop

    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        # Stateless, so no need to learn anything. Just return self.
        return self

    def transform(self, X):
        # Applies the transformation
        X_dropped = np.delete(X, self.indices_to_drop, axis=1)
        return X_dropped

# Example Usage
X_data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
dropper = FeatureDropper(indices_to_drop=[1])
X_transformed = dropper.fit_transform(X_data)
print(X_transformed)
# Expected output: [[1, 3], [4, 6]]
```

## Section 7.2. FunctionTransformer

This section introduces `FunctionTransformer`, a utility that quickly converts simple functions into compliant scikit-learn transformers without needing full class definition.

### Wrapping arbitrary NumPy/pandas operations

For simple, stateless operations that don't require calculating statistics from the training data, defining a full class structure is overkill. The **`sklearn.preprocessing.FunctionTransformer`** allows any Python callable (a function, lambda, or method) that takes $X$ as input and returns $X_{transformed}$ as output to be wrapped into a scikit-learn transformer object.

- **`func`**: The primary function to apply during `transform()`.
- **`inverse_func`**: An optional function to apply during `inverse_transform()`.
- **`validate=True` (Default)**: Ensures the input is a valid 2D NumPy array, which is necessary for pipeline compatibility.

This is ideal for operations like log transformation, squaring features, or custom text cleanup functions. Since it's stateless, its `fit()` method does nothing but return `self`.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer
import numpy as np

# A simple function to apply log transformation
def log_transform(X):
    # Ensure all values are positive before log
    return np.log1p(X)

# Wrap the function into a transformer
log_pipeline_step = FunctionTransformer(
    func=log_transform,
    inverse_func=np.expm1, # The inverse of log1p
    validate=True
)

X_in = np.array([[10, 20], [30, 40]])
X_trans = log_pipeline_step.fit_transform(X_in)
X_orig = log_pipeline_step.inverse_transform(X_trans)

print(f"Transformed (log1p):\n{X_trans}")
print(f"Inverse Transformed (expm1):\n{X_orig.astype(int)}")
```

## Section 7.3. Stateless vs Stateful Transforms

Here, we reinforce the difference between stateless and stateful transformers and their implications for experimental correctness and reproducibility.

### Examples and implications for model reproducibility

The distinction between stateless and stateful transformers is tied directly to the implementation of the `fit()` method and its consequences for model deployment:

1.  **Stateless (No-Op `fit`)**: The transformation relies only on the current input $X$ and fixed hyperparameters. The `fit()` method simply returns `self` without learning any data-dependent attributes.
    - _Example:_ `FunctionTransformer` (by default), `PolynomialFeatures`.
    - _Implication:_ The transformation will be identical regardless of the data used for training vs. testing.
2.  **Stateful (Learned State)**: The transformation relies on statistics or mapping learned during `fit()` on the training data. The `fit()` method computes and stores attributes (e.g., `mean_`, `categories_`).
    - _Example:_ `StandardScaler`, `OneHotEncoder`, custom text length scalers.
    - _Implication:_ The transformation applied to test or live data depends entirely on the state learned from the training data, ensuring **reproducibility** and preventing **data leakage**.

**Rule of Thumb:** If you need to avoid training data leakage, your transformer must be stateful (implement a meaningful `fit`). If the transformation is fixed (e.g., a mathematical function), it should be stateless.

## Section 7.4. Output Control

This section introduces the mechanism for controlling the output format of a transformer, allowing users to return pandas DataFrames instead of the default NumPy arrays.

### Using `set_output(transform="pandas")` for DataFrame outputs

Historically, scikit-learn transformers returned only NumPy arrays, losing feature names and making debugging difficult, especially when using `ColumnTransformer`. The **`set_output(transform="pandas")`** feature, introduced to comply with the proposed **SLEP017 standard**, addresses this.

When `set_output(transform="pandas")` is called on a transformer (or a `Pipeline`/`ColumnTransformer` containing it):

- **Input Requirement:** The input $X$ to `transform()` must be a pandas DataFrame.
- **Output Guarantee:** The `transform()` method (and `fit_transform()`) is guaranteed to return a pandas DataFrame, complete with feature names.

For custom transformers, this requires:

1.  The class to inherit from `sklearn.base.BaseEstimator` (which implements `set_output`).
2.  The `transform` method must take the input feature names (implicitly via a DataFrame) and ensure the output DataFrame has the correct, newly generated feature names (e.g., adding suffixes for one-hot encoding).

This feature significantly improves data readability and integration with the pandas ecosystem.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

X = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [10, 20, 30]})

# 1. Instantiate and set output format
scaler = StandardScaler().set_output(transform="pandas")
pipeline = Pipeline([('scaler', scaler)])

# 2. Fit and Transform
X_scaled_df = pipeline.fit_transform(X)

print(f"Output Type: {type(X_scaled_df)}")
print(f"Output with Feature Names:\n{X_scaled_df.head()}")
# The DataFrame maintains columns 'A' and 'B', now scaled.
```

## Section 7.5. Sparse Safety

In this section, we discuss the necessity of designing custom transformers to correctly handle sparse input matrices to maintain memory efficiency.

### Designing transformers that handle sparse input gracefully

Many scikit-learn steps (e.g., `OneHotEncoder` with many categories, text vectorizers) generate **sparse matrices** (Chapter 2) for memory efficiency. If a custom transformer is inserted into a pipeline that follows such a step, it must be prepared to handle sparse input gracefully.

- **The Default Issue:** Most custom `transform()` methods are written assuming dense NumPy arrays. If a sparse matrix is passed in, array operations will fail or silently convert the sparse matrix to a dense one (`.toarray()`), potentially causing a **memory crash** for large datasets.
- **The Solution:**
  1.  Design the transformation logic to work directly with SciPy sparse matrix methods when possible.
  2.  Use the `check_array` utility from `sklearn.utils.validation` with the `accept_sparse` parameter set to `True` (or a specific format like `'csr'`, `'csc'`).
  3.  If the transformation _must_ be dense (e.g., certain non-linear operations), only convert the matrix to dense if its size is manageable.

**Rule:** If a transformer's logic does not fundamentally rely on the density of the input, it should accept and return the same format it received.

## Code Lab

### Implement a transformer that scales numeric data and one-hot encodes categoricals manually.

We will implement a simple stateful transformer that manually performs a common preprocessing task (scaling) to demonstrate the `fit/transform` contract in practice.

```python
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin
from sklearn.utils.validation import check_is_fitted, check_array
import numpy as np

class ManualMinMaxScaler(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """
    A custom stateful transformer implementing MinMaxScaler manually.
    Scales features to the [0, 1] range.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        # No hyperparameters for simplicity
        pass

    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        # 1. Validate input and ensure it's a 2D array
        X = check_array(X, accept_sparse=False)

        # 2. Learn the state: min and max of each column
        self.min_ = X.min(axis=0)
        self.max_ = X.max(axis=0)
        self.data_range_ = self.max_ - self.min_

        # Avoid division by zero for constant features
        self.data_range_[self.data_range_ == 0.0] = 1.0

        # Must return self
        return self

    def transform(self, X):
        # 1. Ensure the transformer has been fitted
        check_is_fitted(self, ['min_', 'max_'])

        # 2. Validate new input array
        X = check_array(X, accept_sparse=False)

        # 3. Apply the transformation using the learned state
        # X_scaled = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)
        X_scaled = (X - self.min_) / self.data_range_

        return X_scaled

# --- Demonstration ---
X_train = np.array([[10, 1], [20, 2], [30, 3]])
X_test = np.array([[5, 0.5], [35, 3.5]]) # Test data outside train range

# 1. Instantiate and Fit on training data
scaler = ManualMinMaxScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train)

# Learned state: min_=[10, 1], max_=[30, 3], range_=[20, 2]

# 2. Transform test data
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
print(f"Learned Min: {scaler.min_}")
print(f"Transformed Test Data:\n{X_test_scaled}")

# Verify first feature of first sample: (5 - 10) / 20 = -0.25 (out-of-range value)
# Verify second feature of last sample: (3.5 - 1) / 2 = 1.25 (out-of-range value)
```

## Deep Dive

### Error propagation and validation in custom transformers.

The robustness of any custom transformer is defined by its ability to validate input and correctly handle errors, ensuring they propagate appropriately through a complex pipeline.

**Core Validation Utilities:**
Custom transformer developers should utilize scikit-learn's internal validation tools to mimic the behavior of official estimators:

- **`sklearn.utils.validation.check_array(X, **kwargs)`\*\*: The most essential tool. It ensures $X$ is a 2D NumPy array (or handles sparse matrices if configured), handles pandas DataFrame conversion, coerces data types, and raises descriptive errors if the input is malformed.
- **`sklearn.utils.validation.check_is_fitted(estimator, attributes)`**: Used at the beginning of `transform()` or `predict()` to raise a clear `NotFittedError` if the required learned attributes (`_` suffix) are not present.

**Error Propagation:**
The `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` rely on inner steps to raise standard Python exceptions (like `ValueError`, `TypeError`, or `NotFittedError`). If a custom transformer encounters a data issue (e.g., trying to divide by zero, or receiving unexpected data types), it should raise a descriptive `ValueError` rather than allowing a silent failure or low-level exception (like a NumPy or pandas error) to escape the function.

**Example (Inside a Custom Transformer's `transform`):**

```python
# ... (after check_is_fitted and check_array)
if X.shape[1] != self.n_features_in_:
    # Raise a clear ValueError if the number of features changes post-fit
    raise ValueError(
        f"X has {X.shape[1]} features, but this transformer was fitted "
        f"with {self.n_features_in_} features."
    )
```

By using these utilities and standard exceptions, custom transformers become safe and maintainable members of the scikit-learn ecosystem.

## Key Takeaways

The reader should now understand:

- Custom transformers must inherit from **`BaseEstimator`** and **`TransformerMixin`** and implement the **`fit`** and **`transform`** methods.
- **`FunctionTransformer`** is the ideal utility for wrapping simple, stateless functions.
- **Stateful** transformers (those with a meaningful `fit`) are critical for preventing data leakage in pipelines.
- The **`set_output(transform="pandas")`** feature allows transformers to return DataFrames with retained feature names.
- Robust custom transformers must use validation utilities (like **`check_array`** and **`check_is_fitted`**) and be designed to handle **sparse input** gracefully.

With a full understanding of both standard and custom components, we will now turn to the critical role of feature engineering. **Chapter 8. Feature Engineering and Data Flow in Practice** will demonstrate how to apply these tools effectively in real-world scenarios.

## Chapter 8. Feature Engineering and Data Flow in Practice

Feature engineeringâ€”the process of using domain knowledge to create features that make the machine learning algorithm workâ€”is often the most critical step in a successful project. In scikit-learn, effective feature engineering is realized by composing multiple, specialized transformers into robust **preprocessing pipelines** using the `ColumnTransformer` (Chapter 5).

This chapter moves from abstract API concepts to concrete implementation, detailing how to architect comprehensive end-to-end workflows. We will compare and contrast different practical strategies for encoding, scaling, and imputing, and finalize the model by ensuring the entire workflow, including the data preparation logic, is correctly persisted for production use.

## Section 8.1. End-to-End Preprocessing Pipelines

In this section, we define the structure of a robust preprocessing pipeline that can handle a full spectrum of features often found in real-world datasets: numeric, categorical, text, and derived features.

### Numeric, categorical, text, and derived features

A complete preprocessing pipeline typically involves defining separate `Pipeline` objects for each distinct feature type, then combining them within a `ColumnTransformer`.

1.  **Numeric Features:** Require handling of missing values (imputation) and normalization/scaling (e.g., `StandardScaler`).

    $$
    \text{NumPipe} = \text{SimpleImputer} \rightarrow \text{StandardScaler}
    $$

2.  **Categorical Features:** Require handling of missing values (imputation) and conversion to a numeric format (encoding).

    $$
    \text{CatPipe} = \text{SimpleImputer} \rightarrow \text{OneHotEncoder}
    $$

3.  **Text Features:** Require tokenization and numeric representation (vectorization). These are usually handled by dedicated estimators like `TfidfVectorizer` (covered in a later chapter), which can be wrapped in a `ColumnTransformer` step.

4.  **Cyclic Features:** Features like time of day or day of week that have a should be encoded in a way that encapsulates their circular nature. For example like this:

    ```python
    class CyclicTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
        def __init__(self, period):
            self.period = period

        def fit(self, X, y=None):
            return self

        def transform(self, X):
            X = np.asarray(X)
            return np.column_stack(
                [np.sin(2 * np.pi * X / self.period), np.cos(2 * np.pi * X / self.period)]
            )
    ```

5.  **Derived Features:** Features created from existing ones (e.g., age squared, interaction terms, or custom transformations from Chapter 7) are often integrated into the numeric pipeline or created using `PolynomialFeatures`.

The final end-to-end structure is a testament to scikit-learn's composability: a `Pipeline` containing a `ColumnTransformer`, which in turn contains multiple specialized `Pipeline` objects.

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder

# Define the feature subsets (assuming pandas DataFrame input)
NUM_FEATURES = ['A', 'B']
CAT_FEATURES = ['C', 'D']

# 1. Pipeline for numeric features (Impute -> Scale)
numeric_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())
])

# 2. Pipeline for categorical features (Impute -> Encode)
categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
    ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))
])

# 3. Combine pipelines in the ColumnTransformer
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num_pipe', numeric_transformer, NUM_FEATURES),
        ('cat_pipe', categorical_transformer, CAT_FEATURES)
    ],
    remainder='drop' # Drop all other features
)

# 4. Final end-to-end pipeline (Preprocessor -> Model)
final_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('model', None) # Placeholder for the final predictor
])
# This entire object (final_pipeline) is now a single estimator ready for fit/predict.
```

## Section 8.2. Encoding Strategies

This section compares the decision process for selecting categorical encoding techniques based on feature properties and downstream model requirements.

### When to use OneHot vs Ordinal vs Target encoding

The choice of categorical encoding directly impacts model performance and interpretation. Scikit-learn primarily provides lossless, non-data-leaking encoders, but the design choice between them is crucial.

1.  **`OneHotEncoder` (OHE):** Creates a binary column for each category.
    - _Use When:_ Categories have no inherent order (nominal), and the number of unique categories (cardinality) is low to moderate.
    - _Technical Insight:_ OHE output is sparse, which is memory efficient for high cardinality but can lead to the "curse of dimensionality" if the resulting feature matrix becomes too wide. It is required for models that cannot handle categorical inputs directly (like linear models).
2.  **`OrdinalEncoder`:** Maps each category to a sequential integer (e.g., 0, 1, 2).
    - _Use When:_ Categories have a clear, intrinsic order (ordinal data), such as 'small', 'medium', 'large'. The order must be specified manually to prevent arbitrary mapping.
    - _Technical Insight:_ If used on nominal features, it imposes an arbitrary distance metric on the categories that can mislead models, especially linear models, which assume numerical relationships.
3.  **Target/Mean Encoding (External Library/Custom):** Replaces a category with the mean of the target variable ($y$) for that category (e.g., probability of survival).
    - _Use When:_ High-cardinality nominal features are present.
    - _Technical Insight:_ While highly effective, it is highly susceptible to **data leakage** if not implemented carefully within the cross-validation structure. The target mean must be calculated _only_ using the training fold's $y$ values to prevent contamination. Because of this complexity, scikit-learn does not provide a built-in target encoder, encouraging users to rely on external, specialized libraries that enforce correct CV splitting (like `category_encoders`).

## Section 8.3. Scaling Choices

This section analyzes the impact of different feature scaling techniques on various classes of machine learning models.

### The effect of scaling on SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, etc.

Scaling is essential for algorithms sensitive to the magnitude and variance of features. The choice of scaler depends on the model type and the underlying data distribution.

| Scaling Method       | Mathematical Basis                            | When Scaling is Critical                                                                                                      | When Scaling is Optional                                                              |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`StandardScaler`** | $x' = (x - \mu) / \sigma$                     | **Distance-based models:** KNN, K-Means, SVM (with RBF kernel), Neural Networks.                                              | Tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).                                 |
| **`MinMaxScaler`**   | $x' = (x - x_{\min}) / (x_{\max} - x_{\min})$ | Image processing or when a fixed range $[0, 1]$ is required.                                                                  | Linear Models, if interpretability of coefficients in a fixed range is desired.       |
| **`RobustScaler`**   | $x' = (x - Q_2) / (Q_3 - Q_1)$                | When the data contains **significant outliers** that would distort the mean and standard deviation.                           | Any model where robustness to extreme values is preferred over absolute centering.    |
| **No Scaling**       | $x' = x$                                      | **Tree-based models:** These models are invariant to monotonic transformations of features; scaling is generally unnecessary. | Highly interpretable linear models where the raw coefficient magnitude is meaningful. |

**API Consistency:** All standard scikit-learn scalers implement the `fit/transform` contract, ensuring that the necessary statistics ($\mu$, $\sigma$, $x_{\min}$, $x_{\max}$, etc.) are learned solely from the training data, regardless of the complexity of the outer `Pipeline`.

## Section 8.4. Handling Missing Values

This section details how imputation transformers are seamlessly integrated into the preprocessing workflow.

### How imputers integrate with other transformers

Missing data is handled by **imputers** (e.g., `SimpleImputer`, `KNNImputer`), which are specialized transformers. Their position in the `Pipeline` is crucial relative to other steps, especially scaling and encoding.

**Order of Operations (Inside a `Pipeline`):**

1.  **Imputation First (Crucial):** Imputers must run first in the pipeline for a feature subset. Why? Because most subsequent transformers (like `StandardScaler` or `OneHotEncoder`) cannot handle `NaN` values and will raise an error. The imputer's job is to replace `NaN`s with a derived value (like the mean) before the data moves on.

    $$
    \text{Correct Flow} = \text{SimpleImputer} \rightarrow \text{StandardScaler}
    $$

2.  **Imputation State:** `SimpleImputer` is stateful: its `fit()` method learns the replacement value (`median_`, `most\_frequent_`, or `mean_`) _only_ from the training data. This learned value is then applied to fill missing values in the test set, maintaining correctness.
3.  **Advanced Strategies:** The `KNNImputer` uses the $k$-nearest neighbors found in the non-missing data to determine the replacement value. While computationally more expensive than `SimpleImputer`, it can capture feature relationships more effectively. It is still a transformer and must be used within the `Pipeline` framework to prevent test data leakage.

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# Numeric pipeline demonstrating correct order
num_pipe = Pipeline([
    # Imputer runs first to eliminate NaNs
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')),
    # Scaler runs second on the now-complete data
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())
])

X_train = np.array([[10, 1], [np.nan, 2], [30, 3]])
num_pipe.fit(X_train)

# Inspecting the learned imputation value
imputer = num_pipe.named_steps['imputer']
print(f"Learned Mean for Imputation: {imputer.statistics_}") # Column 1: 20.0, Column 2: 2.0
```

## Section 8.5. Saving and Loading Pipelines

This section reinforces the final, critical step of model deployment: serializing the entire fitted workflow for production use.

### Model persistence in production workflows

For a machine learning model to be useful, it must be deployed. In scikit-learn, the object deployed must be the **entire fitted pipeline**, not just the final predictor.

**The Persistence Requirement:** When the final production model makes a prediction on new, raw data $X_{live}$, it must perform the exact same preprocessing steps (imputation, scaling, encoding) using the exact same parameters learned from the original training set.

- **Incorrect Method:** Saving only the `LogisticRegression` object. This requires the deployment code to manually manage and apply the scaling and encoding, leading to version control and consistency errors.
- **Correct Method:** Saving the full, fitted `Pipeline` object via `joblib.dump()`.

```python
import joblib
import os
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Assume 'final_pipeline' is the fitted Pipeline object from the earlier section
final_pipeline.named_steps['model'] = LogisticRegression()
# A simple fit is needed for persistence demonstration
# final_pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 1. Serialization (Saving)
MODEL_PATH = 'full_workflow.joblib'
joblib.dump(final_pipeline, MODEL_PATH)

# 2. Deserialization (Loading in Production)
loaded_pipeline = joblib.load(MODEL_PATH)

# 3. Predict on new, raw data
X_live = pd.DataFrame({'A': [25], 'B': [15], 'C': ['SF'], 'D': ['Q']})
prediction = loaded_pipeline.predict(X_live)

print(f"Pipeline successfully saved, loaded, and used for prediction.")
os.remove(MODEL_PATH) # Cleanup
```

The loaded `loaded_pipeline` is a single object that takes raw features and returns a prediction, encapsulating all the necessary data transformation logic internally.

## Code Lab

### Build an end-to-end pipeline for the Titanic dataset (classification).

This lab utilizes all the major structural components (`Pipeline`, `ColumnTransformer`) and core transformers (`SimpleImputer`, `StandardScaler`, `OneHotEncoder`) to solve a common classification task.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# 1. Load and Prepare Simulated Titanic Data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Survived': [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    'Pclass': [3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1],
    'Age': [22.0, 38.0, 26.0, np.nan, 35.0, 54.0],
    'Fare': [7.25, 71.28, 7.92, 13.0, np.nan, 51.86],
    'Embarked': ['S', 'C', 'S', 'S', 'Q', 'S'],
    'Cabin': ['G6', 'C85', np.nan, 'D26', 'E101', 'A5'] # To be dropped
})

X = data.drop('Survived', axis=1)
y = data['Survived']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

# 2. Define Feature Subsets
NUM_FEATURES = ['Age', 'Fare']
CAT_FEATURES = ['Pclass', 'Embarked']

# 3. Define Preprocessing Pipelines
# Numeric Pipeline: Impute Median -> Scale Z-score
numeric_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())
])

# Categorical Pipeline: Impute Most Frequent -> One Hot Encode
categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
    ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))
])

# 4. Define ColumnTransformer
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numeric_transformer, NUM_FEATURES),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, CAT_FEATURES)
    ],
    remainder='drop' # Drops 'Cabin'
)

# 5. Define Final Classifier Pipeline
clf_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression(random_state=42))
])

# 6. Fit and Evaluate
clf_pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# The pipeline handles all imputation, scaling, and encoding automatically
test_score = clf_pipeline.score(X_test, y_test)
print("--- End-to-End Pipeline Lab ---")
print(f"Training Data Shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"Pipeline Test Accuracy: {test_score:.4f}")

# Inspecting the final number of features after transformation:
final_shape = clf_pipeline.named_steps['preprocessor'].transform(X_test).shape
print(f"Final Feature Matrix Shape: {final_shape}")
# 2 Numeric + 3 Pclass OHE + 4 Embarked OHE = 9 features total
```

## Deep Dive

### How transformation steps affect model interpretability.

A key challenge when deploying complex pipelines is linking the final model's learned parameters back to the original, human-readable features. This is a topic called **model interpretation** (Chapter 10).

**The Challenge of Feature Indirection:**
When a `LogisticRegression` model is the final step in a pipeline, its learned coefficient array (`coef_`) has a length equal to the number of features _output_ by the preprocessing steps. This output is a concatenation of the results from the `ColumnTransformer`.

If the original features were $F_{orig}$, the final features $F_{final}$ are related by a mapping $\mathcal{M}$:

$$
F_{final} = \mathcal{M}(\text{Impute}, \text{Scale}, \text{Encode}, \text{Select})(F_{orig})
$$

The coefficient vector $\beta$ learned by the model is $\beta = [\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n]$, where $n = |F_{final}|$.

**The Solution: `get_feature_names_out()`:**
To interpret $\beta_i$, we must know which original feature generated $F_{final, i}$. This is precisely the function of the `ColumnTransformer`'s `get_feature_names_out()` method (Chapter 5).

1.  The `ColumnTransformer` internally tracks feature names and applies the `__` (double-underscore) naming convention to them as they are transformed (e.g., `num__Age` or `cat__Pclass_3`).
2.  After the pipeline is fitted, calling `clf_pipeline.named_steps['preprocessor'].get_feature_names_out()` returns the exact list of final feature names.
3.  This list is then used to map the coefficients from `clf_pipeline.named_steps['classifier'].coef_` back to their corresponding transformed feature names, enabling interpretation.

**Design Principle:** Scikit-learn's architecture ensures that while the data flow is complex, the metadata (feature names) required for interpretation is preserved and accessible via standardized methods, maintaining transparency even in the most elaborate preprocessing workflows.

## Key Takeaways

The reader should now understand:

- **End-to-End Pipelines** are constructed by nesting specialized `Pipeline` objects for each feature type within a parent **`ColumnTransformer`**.
- The choice between **`OneHotEncoder`** and **`OrdinalEncoder`** depends on the nominal or ordinal nature of the categorical data.
- **Scaling** is critical for distance-based models but unnecessary for tree-based models. **`SimpleImputer`** must run before scaling/encoding in any pipeline branch.
- The entire, fitted workflow (including the data preparation logic) must be persisted using **`joblib.dump`** for deployment correctness.
- Model interpretability relies on tracing features names through the transformation process using **`get_feature_names_out()`**.

The guide has now covered the complete, practical construction of a machine learning workflow. **Chapter 9. Internals and Meta-Estimators** will shift focus to the underlying machinery that enables this elegant composition.
