## Czech Pronunciation Guide

The very first step to speaking any new language with confidence is getting a feel for its sounds. Czech is a beautiful, phonetic language, which means once you learn how each letter or combination of letters sounds, you can pretty much read _anything_! This is a huge advantage over languages like English or even French, where spelling can be a wild guessing game.

Let's break down the Czech alphabet and its sounds. Don't worry, many sounds are just like what you already know in French or English. We'll focus on the ones that are a little different and make them your new best friends!

### Vowels: The Heart of Czech Sounds

Czech vowels are generally **short** or **long**. The long vowels are marked with an acute accent (á, é, í, ó, ú) or a little circle (ů). Think of the accent like the duration mark you might see in music — it simply means hold the sound longer!

| Czech Vowel | Phonetic Transcription | Similar to... (French/English)                                 | Notes                                                                                             |
| :---------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **a**       | /a/                    | French **a** in _chat_                                         | Short and open.                                                                                   |
| **á**       | /aa/                   | French **a** in _pâte_ (longer)                                | Hold it longer than 'a'.                                                                          |
| **e**       | /e/                    | French **e** in _le_ or English **e** in _bed_                 | Short and clear.                                                                                  |
| **é**       | /ee/                   | French **é** in _thé_ or English **ea** in _bear_ (but longer) | Hold it longer than 'e'.                                                                          |
| **i / y**   | /i/                    | French **i** in _fini_ or English **i** in _kit_               | These two letters sound _exactly_ the same in Czech! The difference is grammatical, not phonetic. |
| **í / ý**   | /ii/                   | French **i** in _vie_ or English **ee** in _feel_              | Hold it longer than 'i'.                                                                          |
| **o**       | /o/                    | French **o** in _mot_ or English **o** in _pot_                | Short and clear.                                                                                  |
| **ó**       | /oo/                   | French **eau** in _eau_ or English **o** in _go_ (longer)      | Hold it longer than 'o'.                                                                          |
| **u**       | /u/                    | French **ou** in _nous_ or English **oo** in _look_            | Short and clear.                                                                                  |
| **ú**       | /uu/                   | French **ou** in _vous_ or English **oo** in _moon_            | Always at the beginning of a word.                                                                |
| **ů**       | /uu/                   | Same as **ú**, but only in the middle or at the end of a word. | This is just a different way to write the long 'u' sound depending on its position.               |

### Consonants: Familiar Friends and New Sounds!

Many Czech consonants are similar to French or English, especially at the beginning of words. But watch out for those little marks (called **carons** or _háček_ in Czech — you'll often see them above letters like s, c, z). They change the sound quite a bit!

| Czech Consonant                           | Phonetic Transcription | Similar to... (French/English)                                                                               | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **b, d, f, h, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, v, z** | (standard)             | Mostly like in French or English.                                                                            | _H_ is a soft 'h' sound, like in English 'hat', not silent like in French _heure_.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **c**                                     | /ts/                   | English **ts** in _cats_ or French _tz_ in _pizza_ (Italian style)                                           | Always a 'ts' sound, never a 'k' or 's'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **ch**                                    | /x/                    | Scottish **ch** in _loch_ or German **ch** in _Bach_                                                         | A single sound, like you're clearing your throat gently.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Often written just 'd' when next to 'i' or 'e'.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **ě**                                     | /nye/                  | French **gn** in _gagner_ + **e** / English **ny** in _canyon_ + **e**                                       | This one's tricky! It's 'n' followed by a soft 'y' sound. Often written 'ne' when next to 'n'.                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **ř**                                     | /rzh/ (or /r/ + /zh/)  | Imagine saying a trilled French 'r' and then simultaneously saying the 's' in English _measure_ (like 'zh'). | This is often the _trickiest_ sound for learners! Don't get discouraged if it takes time. Practice saying 'r' (like the trilled French 'r') and then adding the 'zh' sound (like the 'j' in _jour_ or 's' in _measure_) on top. It's a rolled 'r' with a 'zh' buzz. |
| **š**                                     | /sh/                   | English **sh** in _shoe_ or French **ch** in _chaise_                                                        | Like the 'sh' in 'she'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Often written just 't' when next to 'i' or 'e'.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Stress and Intonation: A Czech Superpower!

Here’s a fantastic rule that makes Czech pronunciation much simpler than French or English:

**Czech word stress is almost always on the FIRST syllable.**

This is a huge relief! You don't have to guess where to put the emphasis. Just hit that first syllable a little harder, and you're good to go.

- **A**-hoj (/A-hoy/)
- **Do**-brý den (/DO-bree den/)
- **Češ**-ti-na (/CHESHTI-na/)
