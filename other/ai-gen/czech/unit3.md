# Unit 3: Navigating & Describing - Your First Cases

Ahoj! You've mastered greetings, introductions, basic verbs, and even numbers up to 100! That's incredible progress. Now, get ready for a big step: we're diving into **grammatical cases**. Don't let that word scare you! Think of cases as little clues that tell you a word's job in a sentence (is it the actor? the object? the location?). French and English don't have them in the same way, but they're fundamental to Czech. We'll introduce them gently, focusing on practical usage first. By the end of this unit, you'll be able to ask for directions, order food, shop, and describe things around you. Pojďme na to!

## Chapter 12: Asking "Where?" & Saying "Here/There"

One of the first things you often need to do in a new place is ask where something is! This chapter will equip you with those essential phrases and introduce you to some common prepositions of location.

**Examples in Action:**

Imagine you're trying to find your way around Prague:

**Dialogue 1: Looking for the toilet (a universal need!)**
**You:** Promiňte, prosím, kde je toaleta?
/PRO-min-tye, PRO-seem, GDE ye TO-a-le-ta/
_(Excuse me, please, where is the toilet?)_
**Local:** Toaleta je tady.
/TO-a-le-ta ye TA-di/
_(The toilet is here.)_

**Dialogue 2: Asking about a landmark**
**You:** Kde je Karlův most?
/GDE ye KAR-loov MOST/
_(Where is Charles Bridge?)_
**Local:** Karlův most je tam.
/KAR-loov MOST ye TAM/
_(Charles Bridge is there.)_

**Dialogue 3: Using prepositions of location**
**You:** Kde jsi?
/GDE si/
_(Where are you? [informal])_
**Friend:** Jsem v restauraci.
/ysem v RES-tow-ra-tsi/
_(I am in the restaurant.)_
**You:** A kde je Petr?
/A GDE ye PETR/
_(And where is Petr?)_
**Friend:** On je u nádraží.
/on ye oo NAAD-ra-zhee/
_(He is at/by the train station.)_
**You:** A kde je kniha?
/A GDE ye KNI-ha/
_(And where is the book?)_
**Friend:** Kniha je na stole.
/KNI-ha ye na STO-le/
_(The book is on the table.)_

| **na** (+ location) | /na/                   | on / at         | Used for being _on_ a surface or _at_ certain public places. The noun often changes form after 'na', e.g., _na náměstí_ (at the square), _na stole_ (on the table). |
| **u** (+ location)  | /oo/                   | at / by         | Used for being _next to_ or _near_ something. The noun often changes form after 'u', e.g., _u nádraží_ (by the train station).                                      |

**Grammar Breakdown: Simple Prepositions of Location (The "Where?" Case)**

In Czech, when you ask "Kde je...?" (Where is...?) and then state the location, the noun for that location often changes its ending. This is your first encounter with Czech grammatical cases, specifically what's called the **Locative case** for _v_ and _na_, and the **Genitive case** for _u_.

**Don't worry about memorizing the case names or full declension tables yet!** For now, the most important thing is to recognize the patterns and learn these common phrases as fixed expressions. Your brain will start to intuitively grasp the changes.

- **v** (in/at):
  - _v restauraci_ (in the restaurant) - _restaurace_ (Nom.) $\rightarrow$ _restauraci_
  - _v Praze_ (in Prague) - _Praha_ (Nom.) $\rightarrow$ _Praze_
  - _v hotelu_ (in the hotel) - _hotel_ (Nom.) $\rightarrow$ _hotelu_
- **na** (on/at):
  - _na stole_ (on the table) - _stůl_ (Nom.) $\rightarrow$ _stole_
  - _na náměstí_ (at the square) - _náměstí_ (Nom.) $\rightarrow$ _náměstí_ (no change here!)
- **u** (at/by):
  - _u nádraží_ (by the train station) - _nádraží_ (Nom.) $\rightarrow$ _nádraží_ (no change here!)

**Key takeaway:** When you use _v, na,_ or _u_ to say _where_ something is, the noun might look a little different. Just learn these common phrases for now, and you'll naturally start picking up the patterns.

## Chapter 13: Ordering Food & Drinks (The Nominative & Accusative Cases)

One of the most enjoyable parts of visiting a new country is trying the local cuisine and drinks! This chapter will teach you how to politely express what you'd like to order, and introduce you to your first two formal grammatical cases.

**Examples in Action:**

Imagine you're in a traditional Czech hospoda (pub) or a cozy kavárna (cafe):

**Dialogue 1: Ordering a drink**
**Waiter:** Dobrý den, co si dáte?
/DO-bree DEN, tso si DAA-te/
_(Good day, what will you have?)_
**You:** Dobrý den. Chtěl bych pivo, prosím.
/DO-bree DEN. KHTYEL bikh PI-vo, PRO-seem/
_(Good day. I would like a beer, please. [if you are a man])_
**Waiter:** Tady je pivo.
/TA-di ye PI-vo/
_(Here is the beer.)_
**You:** Děkuji!
/DYE-ku-yi/
_(Thank you!)_

**Dialogue 2: Ordering coffee and water**
**You:** Chtěla bych kávu a vodu, prosím.
/KHTYE-la bikh KAA-voo a VO-doo, PRO-seem/
_(I would like a coffee and water, please. [if you are a woman])_
**Waiter:** Ano, hned to bude.
/A-no, hnet to BU-de/
_(Yes, it will be ready soon.)_

| **chtěl bych...**  | /KHTYEL bikh/          | I would like... |                     |                 | **If you are a man.** This is a polite, conditional form.   |
| **chtěla bych...** | /KHTYE-la bikh/        | I would like... |                     |                 | **If you are a woman.** This is a polite, conditional form. |

**Grammar Breakdown: The Nominative & Accusative Cases**

This is where we officially meet two of the seven Czech grammatical cases:

1.  **Nominative Case:** This is the "base" form of the noun, the one you find in the dictionary. It's used for the **subject** of the sentence – the one _doing_ the action or the one _being_ something.

    - Example: **Káva** je dobrá. (The coffee is good.) - _Káva_ is the subject.
    - Example: **Chléb** je velký. (The bread is big.) - _Chléb_ is the subject.

2.  **Accusative Case:** This case is used for the **direct object** of the verb – the thing that _receives_ the action. When you "want" something or "have" something, that "something" will often be in the Accusative case.

    Let's look at how common noun genders change (or don't change!) in the Accusative when they are direct objects, especially after verbs like "chtít" (to want) or in our polite phrase "chtěl/a bych..." (I would like...).

    - **Feminine Nouns ending in -a:** These are the most noticeable! The **-a** usually changes to **-u**.
      - Nominative: **káva** (coffee), **voda** (water), **polévka** (soup)
      - Accusative: **kávu**, **vodu**, **polévku**
      - Example: Chtěl/Chtěla bych **kávu**. (I would like coffee.)
    - **Masculine Inanimate Nouns (things, not people/animals):** These often **do not change** their ending in the Accusative case! Easy!
      - Nominative: **chléb** (bread), **sýr** (cheese)
      - Accusative: **chléb**, **sýr**
      - Example: Chtěl/Chtěla bych **chléb**. (I would like bread.)
    - **Neuter Nouns:** For now, these also **do not change** their ending in the Accusative case!
      - Nominative: **pivo** (beer)
      - Accusative: **pivo**
      - Example: Chtěl/Chtěla bych **pivo**. (I would like beer.)

**Key takeaway:** When you want to say "I would like [something]," remember:
_ `Chtěl bych` (if you are a man) or `Chtěla bych` (if you are a woman)
_ For feminine words ending in `-a`, change it to `-u`. \* For masculine inanimate or neuter words, the form usually stays the same as the Nominative.

**Cultural Note: Czech Beer Culture – Beyond the Pint**

You can't talk about Czech food and drink without talking about beer! Czechs consume more beer per capita than any other nation, and it's a huge part of their culture.

- **Pivo** (beer) is often cheaper than water in pubs.
- **Pilsner Urquell** (Plzeňský Prazdroj) is the original Pilsner lager, brewed in Plzeň, and is iconic.
- **Kozel, Staropramen, Gambrinus** are other popular brands.
- **"Na zdraví!"** /na ZDRAA-vee/ (Cheers! To your health!) is the common toast. Look people in the eye when you clink glasses!
- Ordering "jedno pivo" (one beer) is very common. You don't need to specify size, a standard "půllitr" (half-liter) is assumed.
- The foam is important! A good Czech beer has a thick, creamy head. It's not just for show; it's part of the taste and keeps the beer fresh.

## Chapter 14: Shopping & Prices in the City

Being able to ask about prices and buy things is super practical. This chapter builds on your numbers knowledge and introduces common shopping vocabulary.

**Examples in Action:**

/To STO-yee TRZHI-tset KO-run/
_(It costs thirty crowns.)_
**You:** Děkuji. Chtěl bych chléb, prosím.
/DYE-ku-yi. KHTYEL bikh HLEB, PRO-seem/
_(Thank you. I would like bread, please. [if you are a man])_
**Shopkeeper:** Tady je váš chléb.
/TA-di ye VAASH HLEB/
_(Here is your bread.)_

**Dialogue 2: Buying souvenirs at a market**
**You:** Dobrý den. Kolik stojí ta kniha?
/DO-bree DEN. KO-lik STO-yee ta KNI-ha/

**Vendor:** Ta kniha stojí sto padesát korun.
/Ta KNI-ha STO-yee STO PA-de-saat KO-run/
_(That book costs one hundred fifty crowns.)_
**You:** Děkuji. Vezmu si ji.
/DYE-ku-yi. VEZ-moo si yi/
_(Thank you. I'll take it.)_

| **koruna**          | /KO-ru-na/             | crown (CZK)            | The Czech currency. Plural is _koruny_ (2-4), _korun_ (5+). |
| **obchod**          | /OP-khot/              | shop / store           | Masculine noun.                                             |

| **peníze**          | /PE-nee-ze/            | money                  | Plural noun.                                                |
| **bankomat**        | /BAN-ko-mat/           | ATM                    | Masculine noun.                                             |
| **platit**          | /PLA-tit/              | to pay                 | Verb.                                                       |
| **vezmu si...**     | /VEZ-moo si/           | I'll take...           | Useful phrase for purchasing.                               |

**Grammar Note:** The verb **"stát"** (to cost) is used in the singular **"stojí"** for "it costs" regardless of whether the item is singular or plural. "Kolik to stojí?" literally means "How much does _it_ cost?". If you ask about specific items, the question changes slightly: "Kolik stojí **chléb**?" (How much does the bread cost?) or "Kolik stojí **ty suvenýry**?" (How much do _those_ souvenirs cost?). Don't worry about this difference for now; "Kolik to stojí?" is always safe.

## Chapter 15: Adjectives: Making Things Pretty (Nominative & Accusative Agreement)

So far, you've learned to identify nouns. Now, let's make your descriptions more colorful! Adjectives are words that describe nouns (like "good," "big," "small"). In Czech, adjectives change their endings to **agree** with the noun they describe in terms of **gender**, **number**, and **case**. This is a concept you're already familiar with from French (e.g., _grand/grande_, _petits/petites_).

**Examples in Action:**

**Grammar Breakdown: Adjective Agreement (Nominative & Accusative)**

Just like in French where _grand_ becomes _grande_ for a feminine noun, Czech adjectives change their endings. The ending depends on:

1.  **The Gender of the Noun** (Masculine, Feminine, Neuter)
2.  **The Case of the Noun** (Nominative, Accusative, etc. - for now, just these two)
3.  **The Number of the Noun** (Singular or Plural)

Let's look at singular adjective endings for **Nominative** and **Accusative** cases, paired with the adjectives _dobrý_ (good) and _velký_ (big).

**1. Nominative Case (when the adjective describes the subject):**

| Noun Gender   | Adjective Ending (Masc. Inanimate) | Adjective Form | Example Noun    | English Example  |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------- | :------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- |
| **Masculine** | -ý                                 | **dobrý**      | _chléb_ (bread) | a good bread     |
|               | -ý                                 | **velký**      | _hotel_ (hotel) | a big hotel      |
| **Feminine**  | -á                                 | **dobrá**      | _káva_ (coffee) | a good coffee    |
|               | -á                                 | **velká**      | _restaurace_    | a big restaurant |
| **Neuter**    | -é                                 | **dobré**      | _pivo_ (beer)   | a good beer      |
|               | -é                                 | **velké**      | _město_ (city)  | a big city       |

**2. Accusative Case (when the adjective describes the direct object):**

Remember, the Accusative form of the noun sometimes changes (like feminine -a to -u), and the adjective changes to match it!

| Noun Gender   | Adjective Ending (Masc. Inanimate) | Adjective Form | Example Noun (Acc.) | English Example                  |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------- | :------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------- |
| **Masculine** | -ý                                 | **dobrý**      | _chléb_ (bread)     | I want a good bread. (no change) |
|               | -ý                                 | **velký**      | _hotel_ (hotel)     | I see a big hotel. (no change)   |
| **Feminine**  | -ou                                | **dobrou**     | _kávu_ (coffee)     | I want a good coffee.            |
|               | -ou                                | **velkou**     | _restauraci_        | I see a big restaurant.          |
| **Neuter**    | -é                                 | **dobré**      | _pivo_ (beer)       | I want a good beer. (no change)  |
|               | -é                                 | **velké**      | _město_ (city)      | I see a big city. (no change)    |

**Comparison: Adjective Agreement in Czech versus French**

You're already familiar with adjective agreement in French, which should make this concept much easier to grasp:

- **French:**
  - _un grand livre_ (a big book - masculine singular)
  - _une grande ville_ (a big city - feminine singular)
- **Czech:**
  - _velká kniha_ (a big book - feminine singular) $\rightarrow$ _kniha_ is feminine
  - _velké město_ (a big city - neuter singular) $\rightarrow$ _město_ is neuter
  - _velký chléb_ (a big bread - masculine singular) $\rightarrow$ _chléb_ is masculine

While the specific endings are different, the _concept_ of adjectives changing to match their nouns is the same. Just remember that Czech has three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) in the singular, and the ending changes depending on the case.

## Chapter 16: Possessive Pronouns: Mine, Yours, His, Hers

Now that you can describe things, let's learn how to say _whose_ they are! Possessive pronouns (like "my," "your," "his," "her") tell us about ownership.

**Examples in Action:**

**Dialogue 1: My coffee, your water**
**You:** To je moje káva.
/To ye MO-ye KAA-va/
_(That is my coffee.)_
**Friend:** A to je tvoje voda.
/A to ye TWO-ye VO-da/
_(And that is your water.)_

**Dialogue 2: His book, her phone**
**You:** To je jeho kniha.
/To ye YE-ho KNI-ha/
_(That is his book.)_
**Friend:** A to je její telefon.
/A to ye YEY-ee TE-le-fon/
_(And that is her phone.)_

**Vocabulary Table: Possessive Pronouns (Nominative Singular)**

| Czech Possessive Pronoun (Masculine) | Phonetic Transcription | English Meaning      | Notes                                           |
| :----------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **můj**                              | /mooy/                 | my                   | Changes for gender and case.                    |
| **tvůj**                             | /tvooy/                | your (informal)      | Changes for gender and case.                    |
| **jeho**                             | /ye-ho/                | his                  | **Does NOT change** for gender or case! Easy!   |
| **její**                             | /yey-ee/               | her                  | **Does NOT change** for gender or case! Easy!   |
| **náš**                              | /naash/                | our                  | (We'll cover this and other plural forms later) |
| **váš**                              | /vaash/                | your (formal/plural) | (We'll cover this and other plural forms later) |
| **jejich**                           | /yey-ikh/              | their                | (We'll cover this later)                        |

**Grammar Breakdown: Possessive Pronoun Agreement**

Here’s the good news and the even better news:

- **The "good news" (for _můj_ and _tvůj_):** Just like adjectives, _můj_ (my) and _tvůj_ (your, informal) change their endings to agree with the **gender, number, and case of the thing being possessed.**
- **The "even better news" (for _jeho_ and _její_):** _Jeho_ (his) and _její_ (her) are **invariable**! They never change, no matter the gender or case of the noun they describe. Phew!

Let's look at _můj_ and _tvůj_ in the **Nominative** and **Accusative** singular, just like adjectives:

**1. Nominative Case (when the possessed item is the subject):**

| Noun Gender   | Possessive Form for "my" | Possessive Form for "your (informal)" | Example Noun | English Example       |
| :------------ | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :----------- | :-------------------- |
| **Masculine** | **můj**                  | **tvůj**                              | _telefon_    | my phone / your phone |
| **Feminine**  | **moje**                 | **tvoje**                             | _kniha_      | my book / your book   |
| **Neuter**    | **moje**                 | **tvoje**                             | _pivo_       | my beer / your beer   |

**2. Accusative Case (when the possessed item is the direct object):**

| Noun Gender   | Possessive Form for "my" (Acc.) | Possessive Form for "your (informal)" (Acc.) | Example Noun (Acc.) | English Example                                      |
| :------------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Masculine** | **můj**                         | **tvůj**                                     | _telefon_           | I want my phone. (no change)                         |
| **Feminine**  | **moji** / **mou**              | **tvoji** / **tvou**                         | _knihu_             | I want my book. (note: _moji/tvoji_ are also common) |
| **Neuter**    | **moje**                        | **tvoje**                                    | _pivo_              | I want my beer. (no change)                          |

**Analogy: Possessive Pronouns as Little Adjectives that Change Form**

Think of _můj_ and _tvůj_ as acting very much like adjectives. They "agree" with the noun they're attached to. If you understand adjective agreement, this will feel very similar. The good news is that _jeho_ and _její_ don't do this dance!

## Chapter 17: Demonstrative Pronouns: This and That

Finally, let's learn how to point things out! Demonstrative pronouns (like "this" and "that") help you specify which item you're talking about.

**Examples in Action:**

**Dialogue 1: Pointing out a book**
**You:** Líbí se mi tato kniha.
/LEE-bee se mi TA-to KNI-ha/
_(I like this book.)_
**Friend:** Ale tamta je hezčí.
/A-le TAM-ta ye HEZ-chee/
_(But that one there is nicer.)_

**Dialogue 2: Buying that beer**
**You:** Chtěl bych tamto pivo, prosím.
/KHTYEL bikh TAM-to PI-vo, PRO-seem/
_(I would like that beer, please. [man speaking])_

**Vocabulary Table: Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative Singular)**

| Czech Demonstrative (Masculine) | Phonetic Transcription | English Meaning  | Notes                                                                         |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------------- | :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **tento**                       | /TEN-to/               | this (masculine) | Changes for gender and case. More common for "this."                          |
| **ten**                         | /ten/                  | that (masculine) | Can also mean "this," but generally more "that." Changes for gender and case. |
| **tuto**                        | /TU-to/                | this (feminine)  | Rarely used in modern Czech for "this." Usually _tato_.                       |
| **ta**                          | /ta/                   | that (feminine)  |                                                                               |
| **toto**                        | /TO-to/                | this (neuter)    | Often shortened to just _to_ for "this."                                      |
| **to**                          | /to/                   | that (neuter)    |                                                                               |

**Grammar Breakdown: Demonstrative Pronoun Agreement**

Demonstrative pronouns behave very much like adjectives and _můj/tvůj_. They change their endings to agree with the **gender, number, and case of the noun** they refer to.

Let's focus on the singular **Nominative** and **Accusative** forms for "this" (_tento_) and "that" (_ten_).

**1. Nominative Case (when the item being pointed out is the subject):**

| Noun Gender   | Form for "this" | Form for "that" | Example Noun | English Example         |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :-------------- | :----------- | :---------------------- |
| **Masculine** | **tento**       | **ten**         | _stůl_       | this table / that table |
| **Feminine**  | **tato**        | **ta**          | _kniha_      | this book / that book   |
| **Neuter**    | **toto**        | **to**          | _město_      | this city / that city   |

**2. Accusative Case (when the item being pointed out is the direct object):**

| Noun Gender   | Form for "this" (Acc.) | Form for "that" (Acc.) | Example Noun (Acc.) | English Example                |
| :------------ | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| **Masculine** | **tento**              | **ten**                | _stůl_              | I want this table. (no change) |
| **Feminine**  | **tuto** / **tuto**    | **tu**                 | _knihu_             | I want this book.              |
| **Neuter**    | **toto**               | **to**                 | _město_             | I want this city. (no change)  |

**Practical Usage in Shopping or Describing Objects:**

- You'll often hear **"Tohle"** /TO-hle/ or **"Tamtohle"** /TAM-to-hle/ used informally in conversation, which means "this one" or "that one" respectively. It's like a simplified, all-purpose "this/that thing." So, "Kolik tohle stojí?" (How much does this cost?) is very common.
- When pointing, a simple "Tohle, prosím" (This one, please) can be enough.

### What You Learned

Výborně! (Excellent!) You've just tackled a significant part of Czech grammar: the cases! While we only scratched the surface, you've gained crucial practical skills.

Here’s a recap of your new abilities:

- **Navigating Like a Pro:** You can ask "Where is...?" (_Kde je...?_) and understand basic location phrases using _tady, tam, v, na,_ and _u_.
- **Ordering with Confidence:** You can politely order food and drinks using _Chtěl/Chtěla bych..._ and apply the first changes of the **Accusative case** for direct objects.
- **Shopping Smarts:** You can ask "How much does it cost?" (_Kolik to stojí?_) and understand basic prices in Czech crowns.
- **Colorful Descriptions:** You can now use basic adjectives like _dobrý, velký, malý,_ and understand how they **agree** with nouns in gender and case.
- **Possession Pointers:** You can say "my," "your," "his," and "her" for single items, recognizing how _můj_ and _tvůj_ agree like adjectives, while _jeho_ and _její_ stay put!
- **Pointing Out Items:** You can use "this" (_tento/tato/toto_) and "that" (_ten/ta/to_) to specify objects, seeing how they also agree with nouns.

You've made tremendous progress and laid a solid foundation for understanding the flexibility of Czech nouns and adjectives. Don't worry if all the case changes aren't perfectly clear yet; consistent practice will make them second nature. Keep practicing these phrases in real-life scenarios! Na shledanou!
