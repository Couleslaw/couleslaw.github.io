## About

I am a student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague. I enjoy studying mathematics, lately I've been focusing on Set Theory, Ordinary Differential Equations and Number theory. Other than that, I enjoy Sci-fi and Fantasy literature, especially The Witcher series and works by Brandon Sanderson.
