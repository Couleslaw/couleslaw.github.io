## About me

I am a CS student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague. Lately I've been focusing on Set Theory, Ordinary Differential Equations and Number theory. Other than that, I enjoy Sci-fi and Fantasy literature, especially The Witcher series and the works of Brandon Sanderson.

## Favorite projects

- [Introduction to Set Theory](https://raw.githack.com/Couleslaw/my-papers/main/cs/Introduction_To_Set_Theory.pdf) - in Czech
  - about 50 pages long, it covers the basics of the Zermeo-Fraenkel set theory, ordinals and the axiom of choice
  - I believe this to be a good starting point for anyone interested in Set Theory or the foundations of mathematics in general
- [Direction Field Visualizer](https://github.com/Couleslaw/Direction-Field-Visualizer)
  - a python application for visualizing direction fields and an art generator at the same time! There is also an [image gallery](https://github.com/Couleslaw/Direction-Field-Visualizer/wiki/gallery).
- [Introduction to Finite Calculus](https://raw.githack.com/Couleslaw/my-papers/main/cs/Finite_Calculus.pdf) - in Czech
  - Finite Calculus is probably the most interesting field of mathematics that is completely absent from the standard university curriculum. Its beauty lies in its simplicity and power. It essentially allows you to find sums of infinite series as if you were solving integrals.
  - This text is a short introduction to the subject, drawing parallels to the well known differential calculus and culminating in the proof of the Gregory-Newton interpolation formula. There are also about 20 solved exercises.
  - I have first learned about this fascinating topic from the book [Concrete Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics) by Graham, Knuth and Patashnik.
