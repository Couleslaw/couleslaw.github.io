## About me

I am a CS student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague. Lately I've been focusing on set theory and analytical combinatorics. Other than that, I enjoy Sci-fi and Fantasy literature, especially The Witcher series and the works of Brandon Sanderson.

## Favorite projects

- [Project L Digital Board Game](https://github.com/Couleslaw/Project-L)
  - Digital version of the **Project L** [board game](https://www.boardcubator.com/games/project-l/) implemented in Unity.
  - **Project L** is a fast-paced strategic board game for up to 4 players, where you complete puzzles by filling them in with Tetris-like pieces.
  - The game provides a simple API for implementing intelligent agents who can play the game against you or against each other.
  - This was my Individual Software Project (_ročníkový projekt_) at MFF UK.
- [Introduction to Set Theory](https://raw.githack.com/Couleslaw/my-papers/main/cs/Introduction_To_Set_Theory.pdf) - in Czech
  - About 50 pages long, it covers the basics of the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, ordinals and the axiom of choice
  - I believe this to be a good starting point for anyone interested in Set Theory or the foundations of mathematics in general
- [Direction Field Visualizer](https://github.com/Couleslaw/Direction-Field-Visualizer)
  - Python application for visualizing direction fields and an art generator at the same time!
  - The [image gallery](https://github.com/Couleslaw/Direction-Field-Visualizer/wiki/gallery) showcases some of the incredible abstract art that can be created with this tool.
- [Introduction to Finite Calculus](https://raw.githack.com/Couleslaw/my-papers/main/cs/Finite_Calculus.pdf) - in Czech
  - Finite Calculus is probably the most interesting field of mathematics that you've never heard of. Its beauty lies in its simplicity and power. It essentially allows you to find sums of series as if you were solving definite integrals.
  - This text is a short introduction to the subject, drawing parallels to the well known differential calculus and culminating in the proof of the Gregory-Newton interpolation formula. There are also about 20 solved exercises.
  - I have first learned about this fascinating topic from the excellent [Concrete Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics) by Graham, Knuth and Patashnik.
- [Pacman](https://github.com/Couleslaw/Pac-man)
  - The original Pacman game implemented in Unity.
  - My main reference for game mechanics was [The Pac-Man Dossier].(https://pacman.holenet.info/)
